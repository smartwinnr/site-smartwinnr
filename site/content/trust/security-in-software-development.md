        <h2><b>Security in Software Development at SmartWinnr</b></h2>
        <p class="ml-margin-top10"><h4><b>How does Security fit into SmartWinnr software development life-cycle?</b></h4></p>
        <p>Agile processes usually do not have distinct SDLC phases, and this inhibits superposition of older, traditional approaches to gating releases through security checkpoints.</p>
        <p>At the same time, agile workflows let us fix any vulnerabilities quickly, especially in our cloud services. We have a strict internal policy on timeframes for fixing any security issues that have been found.</p>
       <p class="ml-margin-top20"> <h4><b>What security reviews are undertaken before release of new code?</b></h4></p>
        <p>We continously assess the security of all our products.</p>
        <p>Developers conduct code reviews regularly, pre-commit and post-commit in some cases, although these reviews are not specifically security-targeted. The SmartWinnr Security team performs regular targeted code reviews, manual and tools-assisted. From time to time, we engage 3rd party auditors to do wide-scope security reviews for all our products.</p>

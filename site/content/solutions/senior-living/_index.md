            Increase occupancy by gamifying the leading indicators of your sale. Sales cycles vary from memory care to assisted living to independent living to skilled nursing. Create games in SmartWinnr that give points to each Marketing Director and Executive Director focusing on completing activities like number of calls, number of tours, number of deposits, and finally, number of move ins. Run live leaderboards and announce winners to keep the sales teams motivated, even during slow sales months. <br>
            Blend this with the SmartWinnr learning component that trains and helps the Marketing Directors, EDs, and Hospital Liaisons to have the right information to deliver the right message to a specific buyer group. Use micro-learning, gamified assessments and learning paths to drive their knowledge. Hone their messaging skills through SmartWinnr video coaching which helps them practice and perfect their sales pitch and objection handling skills.
            SmartWinnrâ€™s contest track and learning track come together to create a highly successful sales program.

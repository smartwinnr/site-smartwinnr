    <h4 class="ml_body_text_black ml-margin-bottom10">Bring Attention to your Leading Indicators</h4>
    <p>SmartWInnr helps you to bring focus back to your leading indicators that drive the ultimate sales target. Distribute incentives in such a way that it helps you to influence the outcomes that you are looking for.</p>
    <h4 class="ml_body_text_black ml-margin-bottom10">Even out sales across the month or the quarter</h4>
    <p>Break down quarter-end goals into more achievable targets, distributed across the weeks and months. SmartWinnr enables you to track and push out incentives weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly. This encourages your team to meet smaller goals that lead to the larger number at the end of the quarter.</p>

    <h4 class="ml_body_text_black ml-margin-bottom10">Rolled up view for Managers, Drilled Down View for Sales People</h4>

    <h4 class="ml_body_text_black ml-margin-bottom10">Run Challenges to make it more competitive</h4>
    <p>Take your contests to a whole different level by introducing one-on-one and team vs team challenges. This is especially helpful when you want to drive the performance of your top performers and top teams.</p>
    <h4 class="ml_body_text_black ml-margin-bottom10">Create Engagement and Community Building</h4>

    <p>Use a seamless integration to your CRMs to pull the data through REST APIs or upload through excel. Calculations happen immediately through automated scoring rules, while the results are available at real-time on the SmartWinnr mobile app for your sales teams to follow.</p>

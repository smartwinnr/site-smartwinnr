    <h1> Increase Productivity Through Sales Contest </h1>
    <h5 class="ml-margin-bottom10">Most sales organizations run sales contests in some form or the other - it can be a monthly or quarterly contest on different KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) or activities leading to KPIs. You have a large team, there is a lot of tedious excel calculations involved, so the results get published maybe only once a week. And everyone loses interest.</h5>
    <h5 class="ml-margin-bottom10">Introducing you to the world of SmartWinnr Sales Contests. You can run several contests for different teams with different KPIs, at the same time. If you have a seasonal business, change the KPIs as it fits your objectives.</h5>
    <h5 class="ml-margin-bottom10">Use a seamless integration to your CRM to pull the KPI data or upload through excel. Calculations happen immediately through automated scoring rules, while the results are available at real-time on the mobile apps to your sales teams.</h5>

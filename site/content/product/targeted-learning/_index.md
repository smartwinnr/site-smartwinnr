    <p>Your teams are overloaded with information - from trainings, internal portals, communications, product manuals. But do they know that 20% of the information that drives 80% of the deals? Use the Pareto principle to identify that 20% of information. Convert them into short bite-sized SmartFeeds - it could be a product video, or a picture talking about the top 3 differentiators.</p>
    <p>Schedule SmartFeeds to reinforce critical information regularly</p>

    <h4 class="ml_body_text_black ml-margin-bottom10">AI-Driven Automated Assessments that help your team to retain important information</h4>
    <p>Is your sales cycle longer than usual? Is prospecting not bearing results? Are they not able to remember critical data while convincing customers?</p>
    <p>Your problem is knowledge retention. Each sales person has her own way of remembering. What one sales person finds easy to remember, another might not. Existing approaches like training, eLearning are one-size-fits-all.</p>
    <p>Let SmartWinnrâ€™s powerful AI take over for a personalised approach. SmartQuizzes select questions for every sales person in your team, depending on their individual areas of strength and areas of improvements. This approach is helpful when you want to drive readiness for a new product launch, or new hire training.</p>

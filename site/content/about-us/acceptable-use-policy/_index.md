        <h1>Acceptable Use Policy</h1>
        <p class="ml_body_text_black ml-margin-left20">
          At SmartWinnr, our goal is to help you and your team be at the top of the knowledge curve, every day. To do this, we need to keep our products and services running smoothly, quickly, and without distraction. For this to happen, we need help from you,
          our users. We need you not to misuse or abuse our products and services.
        </p>
        <p class="ml_body_text_black ml-margin-left20">
          To describe exactly what we mean by “misuse” or “abuse” – and help us identify such transgressions, and react accordingly – we’ve created this Acceptable Use Policy. Under this policy, we reserve the right to remove content that is inconsistent with the
          spirit of the guidelines, even if it’s something that is not forbidden by the letter of the policy. In other words, if you do something that isn’t listed here verbatim, but it looks or smells like something listed here, we may still remove it.
        </p>
        <p class="ml_body_text_black ml-margin-left20">
          The word ‘services’ refers to all websites owned or operated by SmartWinnr (such as smartwinnr.com, quizprompt.com, and any related websites, sub-domains and pages) as well as any hosted services operated by SmartWinnr (such as SmartWinnr Cloud offerings).
        </p>
        <p class="ml_body_text_black ml-margin-left20">
          SmartWinnr may make reasonable modifications to this Policy from time to time by posting a new version of this document on the SmartWinnr website. Revisions are effective immediately upon posting. Accordingly, we recommend that you visit the SmartWinnr
          website regularly to ensure that your activities conform to the most recent version.
        </p>
        <p class="ml_body_text_black ml-margin-left20">
          Questions about this Policy (e.g., whether any contemplated use is permitted) and reports of violations of this Policy should be directed to <a href="mailto:support@smartwinnr.com?subject=SmartWinnr Support">support@smartwinnr.com</a>
        </p>
        <p class="ml_body_text_black ml-margin-left20">
          The examples listed in this Policy are not exhaustive. Prohibited uses and activities include, without limitation, any use of the Services in a manner that, in SmartWinnr’s reasonable judgment, involves, facilitates, or attempts any of the activities outlined hereon.

<p>In today's rapidly evolving life sciences industry, the way commercial teams consume and retain information has
    fundamentally changed. Like consuming news in small digestible pieces and diving deeper only when interested,
    learning strategies, including ai role play must adapt to modern consumption patterns while maintaining educational
    effectiveness. </p>

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">The Power of Bite-Sized Learning Content </h3>

<p>Modern learners face multiple competing priorities and time constraints. Creating bite-sized learning modules
    combined with ai coaching helps address these challenges by: </p>

        <p>
            Breaking down complex topics into manageable chapters
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Focusing on specific learning objectives per module
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Enabling quick consumption between field activities

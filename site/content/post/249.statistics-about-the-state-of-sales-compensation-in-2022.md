[As a sales executive](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-make-your-sales-compensation-motivating-for-the-managers/), you must be aware of the importance of sales compensation and the impact that it exerts on your salesforce. 

When you build an [effective sales compensation plan](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/the-psychology-behind-an-effective-sales-compensation-strategy/), it helps in,

* Motivating your team to reach unbelievable heights
* Improving their performance and taking it to the next level
* And boosting your salespeople’s overall job satisfaction

And, in converse, a wrong sales compensation plan can do the exact opposite- 

* Demotivate your team 
* Decrease their performance
* And cause high rates of sales rep turnover

If you are planning to create an effective sales compensation plan for the financial year 2022, you need to consider these statistics which explain the current state of sales commission and the new sales commission trends that are emerging.

### **Conclusion of these Statistics**

Now, if you’ve made it this far, you’re probably asking yourself, “So what does all of this mean for me?” So glad you asked!

Here’s our take:

* Salaries, commission structures, and sales incentives vary based on industry. This means there is no one-size-fits-all approach to sales compensation planning. So we recommend, doing your own research and relying on your company, industry and market data to guide your sales compensation planning process.
* Although money certainly motivates sales teams, a combination of monetary compensation, non-monetary compensation, and good old-fashioned recognition will motivate your sales teams most effectively and will increase their overall job satisfaction
* Sales reps need to given more time to sell. They’re spending their time on all sorts of administrative works like data entry and other non-selling activities. As a sales manager or operations leader, it’s time to investigate operational inefficiencies to buy more time for your reps
* Across the board, organizations that implement a [sales incentive program](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/best-practices-to-design-your-sales-incentive-plan/) and who compensate reps well, see more productivity amongst their sales reps and generate more revenue in general.

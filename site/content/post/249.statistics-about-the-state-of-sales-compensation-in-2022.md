[As a sales executive](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-make-your-sales-compensation-motivating-for-the-managers/), you must be aware of the importance of sales compensation and the impact that it exerts on your salesforce. 

When you build an [effective sales compensation plan](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/the-psychology-behind-an-effective-sales-compensation-strategy/), it helps in,

* Motivating your team to reach unbelievable heights
* Improving their performance and taking it to the next level
* And boosting your salespeople’s overall job satisfaction

And, in converse, a wrong sales compensation plan can do the exact opposite- 

* Demotivate your team 
* Decrease their performance
* And cause high rates of sales rep turnover

If you are planning to create an effective sales compensation plan for the financial year 2022, you need to consider these statistics which explain the current state of sales commission and the new sales commission trends that are emerging.

### **Conclusion of these Statistics**

If you’ve made it this far, you’re probably asking yourself, “So what does all of this mean for me?” 

Glad that you’ve asked!


<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>Here’s our take:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Sales salaries, commission structures, and incentives differ based on your industry. So, you need to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to sales compensation planning. We recommend that you do your own research and rely on your company, industry, and market data to guide your sales compensation planning process.</li>
      <li> There is no doubt that money is certainly a huge motivating factor for the sales teams. But when you implement a combination of monetary compensation, non-monetary compensation, and good old-fashioned recognition, it will motivate them most effectively and increase their overall job satisfaction</li>
      <li> Sales reps should be given more time to sell. Currently, most of the sales reps are spending most of their time on all sorts of administrative tasks like data entry and other non-selling activities. As a sales manager or operations leader, it’s high time that you investigate and solve operational inefficiencies to buy more time for your reps</li>
    </ul>

Launching a new product is a journey full of excitement and a touch of nerves. A culmination of countless brainstorming sessions, late-night work marathons, and endless cups of coffee. But the success of that launch doesn't just depend on the brilliance of the product itself. No!! The execution matters. It's also about having a sales team that's ready to rock any conversation. In today's business world, sales teams need more than just a pep talk and a pat on the back.  <br>

So, let's get real for a moment and make a [few checks](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/survey-questions-to-ask-your-sales-team-before-new-product-launch-training/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blogHow%20to%20Coach%20Your%20Sales%20Team%20on%20a%20New%20Product%20Launch?&utm_campaign=How%20to%20Coach%20Your%20Sales%20Team%20on%20a%20New%20Product%20Launch?) before your next product launch: 
<br>

<ul class="ml_checked_list">

  <li>
  <p>Does your sales team understand the new product inside and out?</p></li>
    <li><p>Are they able to identify the target audience and tailor their approach accordingly?</p></li>
    <li><p>Are they trained enough on key selling points and objection handling?</p></li>
    <li><p>Are they able to practice product-specific role plays?</p></li>
    <li><p>Last but most important of all, are there enough trainers to train each one of them and provide 1:1 guidance?</p>
    </li> 

</ul>

This is where <b>two-way AI </b> coaching comes in.  

<h4 class="ml-margin-top-bottom20">What is two-way AI coaching?</h4>

 Every successful launch comes after handling its challenges. From training sales reps to refining product marketing strategies, the [pre-launch phase](https://www.smartwinnr.com/solutions/new-product-launch/?utm_source=blog) is a 
 crucial period. Especially in large enterprises, there’s a new product launched every alternate month. Let’s 
 look into the top 4 challenges.



<h3>Challenges for Large Teams during Product Launch</h3> 

<p>To ease our understanding, starting with an example. Say, Mr. Smith owns a massive corporation with a sales force of 10,000. All gearing up for the next big product launch. It is exciting, but it comes with a significant challenge. Even investing just 30 mins for training becomes a costly endeavor, with the added concern that not every rep will receive individual attention. Yet, the critical task remains. Ensuring that each one of his reps is fully briefed about the new product, all while staying up to date on the existing ones.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Limited Training:</b> Without regular role-playing exercises, sales reps may lack opportunities to refine their sales skills of new products.</P></li>
<li><p><b>Shortage of Trainers: </b> Without personalized training or say 1 trainer for each rep, the delivery of guidance and coaching impacts overall performance.</P></li>
<li><p><b>Training Budget Constraints: </b>As the team grows, so does the demand for effective training. This often shakes off available resources and investments.</P></li>
<li><p><b>Knowledge Retention: </b> With multiple product launches in large enterprises, ensuring information retention among sales reps is a challenge.</P></li>
</ul> 

Navigating these challenges demands a comprehensive approach that not only addresses immediate concerns but also meets long-term success.<br><br>

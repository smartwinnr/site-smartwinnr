Sales Teams are virtual this year too. This means that the [virtual sales kickoffs](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-create-and-implement-a-perfect-virtual-sales-kick-off/) are going to be the flavor of this season as well. I’m sure the [virtual kickoff looks and feels very different than the in-person SKO even](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/virtual-vs-in-person-the-winning-sko/) to your audience. They might feel that your virtual SKO lacks the fun, excitement, and the celebratory environment that they get to experience in the [in-person SKO](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/guide-to-plan-and-execute-a-perfect-sales-kickoff-event/) event.

If you are also experiencing heavy foot traffic before Christmas, make sure to ultilize this opportunity to run some exiting sales contests in your store to engage your reps in bringing in good Christmas profit. Click here to get some amazing Christmas-themed sales contest ideas.

In this blog, we are going to explore some creative names that you can give for your Christmas themed sales contests to double up the excitement for your reps for the contests you organize

**1. Dashing through the Snow:** This contest is named after the line from the Christmas Carol. Organize this contest and encourage your reps to sell the promotional products that are under offer for the Christmas. At the end of the contest, reward the person who has sold highest number of units of the promotional products.

**2. Ho Ho Hoooo!** What can be a better way to greet your contest participants than by using Santa’s laughter as the contest name. This contest is suitable for larger retail stores where each square foot in the store is occupied by one kind of product. Like:

* One section for apparels
* Another section for electronics etc 

This contest helps to improve sales in various sections of the store.

**4. Santa Vs Elfs:** Have you launched some new products for Christmas? Then this contest helps you to increase the sales of those newly launched products. Pit the floor manager against the floor staff and ask them to compete with each other in selling more number of units of the newly launched product. Announce a huge cash reward. If the manager wins he/she gets to take that cash reward. And if the floor staff wins that cash is given to everyone.

**5. Surprise in the Stockings:** Organize this contest for 3 weeks before the Christmas and encourage your reps to try to upsell or cross-sell the products to the shoppers. And at the end of the contest, you can either reward the person who has made the most significant upsell or cross-sell or reward the one who has made the highest amount of upsell or cross-sell.

**6. Santa Soiree:** Run this contest for one month and focus this contest around getting your reps to bring in highest amount of sales revenue. At the end of one month, reward everybody who brought in significant amount of sales with exciting Christmas gifts. Have the floor manager dress up as santa and present these gifts to the winners.

Reward the winners by sponsoring a Christmas family vacation for them.

**9. Xmas Xcitement:** Christmas is usually a very busy time for retail stores and it becomes even more busy on weekends. So you need to make sure that your retail store staff is incentivized to work actively on weekends. Conduct this contest and motivate your staff to work on weekends and reward all employees who have worked productively over the weekends with some exciting Christmas gifts.

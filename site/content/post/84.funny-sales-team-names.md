We can all agree that coming up with a perfect sales team name is a bit of a struggle. A sales team consists of various people with different mindsets and preferences. So, coming up with a team name that appeals to everyone in the team is not an easy task. But, a creative, funny, and inspirational name that resonates with the team spirit, never fails to connect with the team members. Once you find a perfect team name, it brings everyone in the team together and instills a great sense of team pride.

If you are looking for such a perfect name for your sales team then look no further. With this blog, we have brought to you an impressive list of cool, funny, and creative sales team names. Check it out below and pick a name that perfectly fits your sales team.

**1. Disco Ninjas**: This is the sales team that works hard but parties harder whenever they win.

**4. Yewww Crew**: “Yeww” is the sound of excitement and joy that people make in the sports stadiums to cheer for their favorite team. So, give this name to the sales team that is known to celebrate their small and big wins. Now, whenever someone from this team wins a deal, everyone else in the team can cheer up for that sales rep by making some noise-- “yewwwwwww”

**5. Southwest Mighty Ducks**: This name is inspired from the 90’s Disney movie-- The Mighty Ducks. “Southwest” signifies the territory that the team covers (you can change this according to your team’s territory).

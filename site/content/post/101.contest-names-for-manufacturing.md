### **Why run a contest?**

A contest brings a whole level of excitement into a boring day. It's not just about getting your workforce engaged. It's a lot about meeting your business objectives. 

A contest always starts with an end goal in mind. Your business objective drives the structure and format of the contest. Your goal could be:

* Regularly train your workforce

* H&S drives

* SOPs

* Maintenance

* KPI

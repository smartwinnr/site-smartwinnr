            Performance anxiety when practicing in front of peers and managers
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Limited opportunities for practice due to time constraints
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Inconsistent feedback depending on the evaluator
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Scheduling difficulties for both trainers and representatives
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Resource-intensive nature requiring substantial time investment
        </p>
    </li>

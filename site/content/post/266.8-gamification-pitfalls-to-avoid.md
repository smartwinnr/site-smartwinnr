[Gamification](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/what-is-sales-gamification/), as you know, is the process of taking game mechanics and applying them to non-gamified situations. It involves using fun contests or systematized rewards and incentives to drive the behavior of the players and achieve the desired results.

### **1. Not having clear gamification goals**

Ask yourself this question: ‘what is the objective of my [game](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-design-a-march-madness-contest-for-a-smaller-team/)?’

If you don’t get an answer to this question, then you are not likely to engage and captivate your audience.

Before implementing your [gamification](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/gamifying-salesforce/) strategy, you have to decide on the clear objectives of your [game](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-design-a-march-madness-contest-for-a-larger-team/)

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>So make sure that you sit and discuss with your team on what is it that you want to achieve mainly through this competition? </p>
    <p>Here are some popular gamification goals that people usually have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To drive higher levels of employee engagement at work</li>
      <li>To change the behavior of the employees</li>
      <li>To stimulate the creativity of the employees</li>
      <li>To encourage teamwork</li>
      <li>To drive up quarterly or annual sales</li>
      <li>To encourage employees to achieve certain business targets</li>
      <li>To improve customer satisfaction</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whatever your reason might be, make sure that everyone who is involved in the gamification initiative is clear about the ultimate goal of the game.</p>

### **2. Having complicated game mechanics**

Since the primary purpose of [gamification](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/gamification-and-employee-engagement/) is to achieve desired outcomes through a designated pathway, [game](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/improve-employee-engagement-of-your-remote-teams-with-gamification/) mechanics should be simple and straightforward. You don’t want to complicate matters with point systems that are hard to comprehend or leaderboards that involve a complex set of rules and criteria.

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>Keep it as simple as possible so that the players can easily understand</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the target for them to achieve?</li>
      <li>What is the timeframe to achieve that target?</li>
      <li>What <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/kpi-gamification-how-to-select-kpis/">KPIs</a> will be measured in the game?</li>
      <li>How will the points get allotted to them at each step of the game</li>
      <li>What rewards will they win upon reaching the target? etc</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

Gamification doesn’t need to be complicated in order for it to work. In fact, a lot of workplace gamification experts advocate for the simplicity of the games.

The design of gamification should be in such a way that 

* It is easily understood by your players
* It increases their engagement at work 
* And produces desired results for them 
 
If your [game](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/psychology-of-sales-gamification/) mechanics are getting in the way and hindering the outcome of the [game](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/games-for-new-hire-onboarding/) then you may need to take a look at how you can simplify the process

### **3. Inspiring too much or too little competition and frustrating the beginners**

Like most things in this world, balance is the key in gamification as well. So, if it inspires too much or too little competition, you simply will not get the desired results you hoped for.

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>For example,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If your gamification simply rewards the “rock-star performers” and leaves everyone else behind, then you run the risk of a majority of players losing interest in your game and getting disengaged</li>
      <li>On the other hand, if your game has too many low-hanging fruits then it fails to motivate both the low performers and high performers to push their limits.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

So, avoid having overtly ambitious or overtly easy targets which could turn your gamification into “shamification”. 
 
Instead, build missions, levels, categories, and even handicaps into your gamification initiative so that the employees of all experience and skill levels feel that progress is attainable. This way, everyone gets to win something or the other.

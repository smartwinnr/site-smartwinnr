-   What is a Sales Plan?
    
-   What are the benefits of a sales plan?
    
-   What goes into a sales plan?
    
-   And how do you go about writing a sales plan?
    
If you haven’t read the first part yet, here is the link to it.

  

**Tip:** In order to get your basics right about the sales plan, we suggest that you first go through the first part and then come back to read this second part.

  

In this second part, we are going to look at different types of sales plans and some online tools that you can use to easily and quickly create your sales plans

<br>

## **Types of sales plans**

When you think about a sales plan what probably comes to your mind is an annual sales plan. A lengthy document containing a wide spectrum of aspects pertaining to sales.

  

While every sales department needs to have this common, broad sales plan, you can also have various other sales plans that may address short-term and specific sales scenarios.

  

Here we’ll go over a few sales plans:

#### **1. 30-60-90 days Sales Plan**
    

This 30-60-90 day sales plan is defined by the time frame. Here you need to create three goals based on timelines.

-   One for the 30-day mark
    
-   Another for the 60-day mark
    
-   And the last one for the 90-day mark
    

You can choose to focus this plan on various sales targets like,

-   Achieving quotas
    
-   Reducing customer churn by a certain percentage
    
-   Tracking the progress of your new hires in their first 90 days
    

To understand this better, let’s look at an example. Let’s say you have a [new salesperson or sales manager and you want to get her up to speed quickly](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/ramp-up-new-hire-with-preboarding-activities/) in the first quarter of their job. How can you build a plan for this?

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom20">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>Here’s how you create the <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/30-60-90-days-gamified-sales-training-plan/">30-60-90 days new hire ramp-up plan</a> that includes milestones they’d need to achieve.</p>
    <p><b> Day 1 to 30:</b></p>
    <p>Make them understand and learn everything about your company from the processes, customers, products, and procedures.</p>
    <p><b> Day 31 to 60:</b></p>
    <p>
    Make them practice what they have learned through <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/scenarios-where-sales-coaching-can-be-used/">video coaching</a> sessions, <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/5-sales-role-play-games-that-prepares-your-team-to-win/">role-play sessions</a>, mock sales calls, mock <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/10-most-effective-sales-pitch-ideas/">sales pitches</a>, etc
    </p>
    <p><b> Day 61 to 90:</b></p>
    <p>Initiate an action plan and let your new hires practice their selling skills in the real sales world, with real customers. Analyze their progress consistently and make changes if necessary.</p>

#### **2. Sales plan for specific sales**

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">    
    <p>In sales, we use different tactics to approach and convert a prospect into a paying customer. And you can create various sales plans focused specifically on various sales tactics like,</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Call sequences </li>
      <li>Email follow-up frequency,</li>
      <li>Meeting appointments</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
 

This type of sales plan is usually short term like weekly or monthly or quarterly. And it focuses on measuring and improving results for just one goal or task.


#### **3. Territory Sales Plan**
    

Sales managers who oversee a geo-location or region often use territory sales plans to give sales directors and VPs more visibility into their sales efforts.

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10"> 
   <p> This is a workable plan used to target the right customers in the territory and implement goals to increase sales and revenue in that territory over time.</p>
    <p>A good territory sales plan will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Provide details on market trends in that territory, relevant customer personas, compliances, and policies</li>
      <li> Make your team more productive</li>
      <li> Reduce operational costs</li>
      <li> Increase the number of sales generated</li>
      <li> Improve your customer coverage</li>
      <li> Improve working relationships between the clients and the sales reps</li>
    </ul>
  </div>  
</div>  
    

**Note:** It is essential to work on your territory sales plan and avoid making constant changes. Unnecessary changes can tamper with your productivity and your ‘territory’ in general.

#### **4. Market Expansion Plan** 

A market expansion plan typically lays out the strategy for you to [enter into new target markets](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-expand-into-new-markets-efficiently/). It outlines a task list and target metrics that salespeople need to follow to successfully expand the business into a new market.

  

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom20">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10"> 
    <p> While drafting this plan you need to take into account</p>
    <ul>
      <li> The distribution costs (if applicable)</li>
      <li>Time zone differences between your sales reps and target buyers</li>
      <li> Compliances and policies in that industry</li>
      <li> And other logistical factors</li>
    </ul>
  </div>  
</div>  
  

#### **5. New Product Sales Plan**
    
You can create this sales plan when you are going to [launch a new product](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/re-imagined-product-launch/). This plan helps you to create a roadmap for making the new product a success in the market. And successfully generate revenue from it.


<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom20">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">   
    This plan helps you to,
    <ul>
      <li> Carry out <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-gather-competitive-intelligence-from-the-field/">competitive analysis</a></li>
      <li> Strategize new product marketing and brand positioning</li>
      <li> Determine a new product sales strategy</li>
      <li> Secure channel partners if you’re shifting to a channel sales model</li>
    </ul>
  </div>  
</div>  
  

#### **6. Sales Training Plan**
    

A [sales training plan](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/sales-training-and-communication-playbook-for-new-product-launch/) is generally created and used by the [sales enablement team](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/breaking-down-the-impact-of-sales-enablement-on-your-business/).

In this plan, you need to lay out the roadmap for different sales training programs that you are going to conduct for your sales reps.

This plan should include,

-   Sales training programs for different sales roles
    
-   Training schedule
    
-   Sales training resources and tools that need to be used
    
-   Methods and metrics that will be used to measure the knowledge retention
    
-   The training contests and [incentives for the contest winners](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/sales-incentive-ideas-to-keep-your-sales-team-motivated/)
    

#### **7. Sales Budget Plan**
    
A sales budget plan provides all the details related to the sales budget and estimation of revenue generation. It covers the cost of,

-   The staff
    
-   The tools
    
-   Marketing campaigns
    
-   And other resources needed to generate the target revenue.
    

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom20">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10"> 
    <p>A good sales budget plan should include the following:</p>
    <p><b>Sales forecasting:</b></p>
    <p>An estimate of future sales (in terms of revenue) by predicting how much each salesperson or team can sell over a certain period, (i.e. week, month, year, etc).</p>
    <p><b>Anticipated expenses:</b></p>
    <p>Include the number of costs your team is likely going to incur. Remember to have even the smallest expenses included.</p>
    <p><b>Expect the unexpected:</b></p>
    <p>Always leave room for unforeseen circumstances in your sales budget. For example, new packaging expenses, new competitive market strategies, etc.</p>

It’s summertime! You and your team have just wrapped up Q2. Now the sun is out and the weather is nice.  Summer is such a pleasant time for living….. But not for selling.

Summer can be a slow season for salespeople because:

1. Prospects are on vacation. 

2. Every email a rep sends seems to gets an automated out of office reply. 

3. Calls go unanswered. 

4. LinkedIn connection requests remain pending for days.

Even your sales reps daydream about a pool day instead of focusing on the pipeline growth. This is the time when everyone’s hearts turn toward vacation and a much-needed break. So, it can get very hard to continue to fill the funnel with new business. 

This is what is called **summer sales slump**. And, one of the best ways to get over this slump is to conduct some interesting and fun sales contests. Creating and running short summer contests will help greatly in engaging your employees in their work and getting over the slump.

Below are some of the famous summer-themed sales contest ideas that will make your sales reps summer exciting:

<br>

### **1. Race for Sales**

**Goal**: To encourage reps to book more meetings (first-time, follow-up, closing, or all. You choose.)

**Duration**: 2 weeks

**Teams**: Individual

**Points**: 2 points for the first-time meeting, 1 point for follow-up, 3 points for closing

**Winners**: The person who books the most meetings by the end of 2 weeks wins the competition. Have first, second and third winners.

**Prize**: Take the winners out for a day at a race track (Be it race cars, rallycross, dirt bikes, horses, dogs, or something else). Races are a great place to have tons of fun and build team spirit and great memories.

**Competition Theme**: Run a horse race or car race-themed competition. Put up a car race-themed leaderboard where you represent each rep’s progress with a car. Give the participants an option to choose their own car on the leaderboard from the list of different kinds of cars. Now, the car of the salesperson who hits the target first, surpasses the other cars and wins the race.

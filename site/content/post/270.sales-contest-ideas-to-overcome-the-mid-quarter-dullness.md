A sales contest is the most powerful tool that any sales manager can have in their arsenal. They can implement contests to

* Boost their team’s morale 
* Encourage healthy competition on the sales floor
* And increase the overall excitement across the teams

It is the best way to, 

* Get the reps to focus on a specific goal or metric for a short period of time 
* And promote the right activities to achieve those goals. 

Despite having this powerful tool, most managers use sales contests only at the beginning or end of a quarter. 

Because they want to,

* Encourage a great fresh start at the [beginning of a quarter](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-plan-for-a-new-sales-quarter/)
* And excite their reps to close the quarter strong at the end of a quarter 

Not many people realize that the middle of the [quarter](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/tips-that-will-help-you-close-your-q4-strong/) is where a contest can be most effective.

Think about it: The middle of the quarter often feels less urgent. There isn’t immediate motivation to start anew or finish out strong like there is with both the beginning and end. As a result of this, complacency and boredom can set in, within your reps, without much to get fired up about for a while. 

So, arrange some good, exciting sales contests at this time to get your reps fired up. Here we have four ideas to get you started.

\
\

### **1. Sowing Seeds of Success**

**Goal:** To get your reps to sow the seeds of their sales growth by investing their time in prospecting

**Duration:** 1 week

**Points:** 10 points for each prospect entered into the sales pipeline

**How to run this contest?** Run this contest for one week and encourage your reps to invest their time, every day, in bringing a good number of quality prospects into the sales pipeline. At the end of the contest period, check the number of leads and the quality of the leads that each rep has brought in. Reward the one who has got a good number of quality leads than the others in the team.

\
\

### **2. Revisiting Leads/ No Cold Leads**

**Goal:** To get your reps to revisit the leads that have not been touched in the last few months

**Duration:** 1 month

**Points:** 100 points for reengaging the zoned out leads

**How to run this contest?** Run this contest for a period of 1 month and encourage your reps to revisit the leads who haven’t been touched in the last few months and try to re-engage those leads in the sales conversations again. The rep who succeeds in re-engaging the maximum number of leads wins this contest.

\
\

### **3. Progressing Prospects**

**Goal:** To get your reps to progress the stagnant leads to further steps in the sales process

**Duration:** 2 weeks

**Points:** 50 points for each stagnant lead progressed in the sales pipeline

**How to run this contest?** Organize this contest for a period of 2 weeks and encourage your reps to take a look at the sales pipeline, identify the stagnant leads and try to progress them to the next steps in the buying process. Reward points for each progress made. At the end of the contest period, reward the rep who has succeeded in progressing more number of stagnant leads.

\
\

### **4. East Coast Vs West coast**

**Goal:** To get your sales teams to generate the highest amount of monthly sales

**Duration:** One month

**Points:** 100 points per sale made

**How to run this contest?** Organize this contest for a period of 3 weeks and encourage your sales teams in various territories to compete with each other to bring in the highest amount of monthly sales. Keep a track of each team’s progress on a live leaderboard. At the end of the month, reward the team that has brought in the highest amount of sales.

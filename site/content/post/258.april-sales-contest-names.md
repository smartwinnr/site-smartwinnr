The month of April marks the beginning of the second sales quarter. This is the first month in the second sales quarter. So, it’s important that you brace up your sales employees to put in their best efforts and achieve good sales results this month so that the second quarter gets a good beginning.

One best way to charge up your employees is to gamify their sales activities. You can do this by organizing some exciting sales contests on your sales floor. If you need some interesting and exciting April sales contest ideas, [please click here to get them.](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/7-sales-contest-ideas-for-april/) In this blog, however, we are going to focus on some interesting names that you can give for your April sales contests.


1. **Song of success:** Named after the national karaoke week, use this contest to encourage your reps to advance the stagnant opportunities along the pipeline. The rep who manages to advance more opportunities along the pipeline wins this contest
2. **Minute to win:** Organize this contest every day for 120 minutes (2 hours) and encourage your reps to cold call the prospective customers and try to enter them into the sales cycle. Declare winners and reward them every day for calling a maximum number of potential customers
3. **Brew Success:** Conduct this as a team-based contest for one month and encourage your sales teams to compete with each other in closing more sales. At the end of the month, the team that closes the highest number of sales than the other teams wins this contest. The winning team will get a huge bonus and will be taken out for drinks and appetizers at a local restaurant
4. **Health is wealth:** This contest is to celebrate the world health day which is on the 7th of April. In this contest encourage your reps to get in touch with the existing customers and try to earn referrals from them. Select the top 3 people who have earned the highest number of referrals and give them rewards such as 

  * The gym membership
  * Membership to the yoga classes
  * Or provide their (and their family’s) healthcare benefits

5. **How many eggs are in your basket?** This is a contest to celebrate Easter. Organize this contest and encourage your employees to book as many meetings as they can with potential customers. At the end of the contest, reward the person who booked the maximum number of meeting with some exciting Easter prizes
6. **Sowing success:** This is to celebrate the world earth day which is on the 22nd of April. Run this contest and encourage your reps to give a demo of your newly launched product to the potential customers. At the end of the contest period, reward the person who has given the new product demo to more customers than the others in the sales team
7. **Blooming Leads:** This name is given to this contest to celebrate the spring season and the blooming of flowers in the month of April. In this contest, encourage your sales reps to convert as many leads in the sales pipeline as they can into paying customers. Then reward the person who manages to convert the highest number of leads at the end of the contest.
8. **Make it count:** Focus this contest around encouraging your reps to express their clients in every interaction that they have with them. Keep a track of each rep's interaction with each of their clients across various channels and reward the person who consistently drives the most exciting and impressive customer interaction.
9. **Second chances:** Conduct this contest and encourage your reps to retry to engage with the contacts that couldn’t be moved forward in the first quarter. Reward everybody who successfully closes deals with at least one of those lost contacts
10. **Extraordinary beginning:** Focus this contest around getting your reps to bring in good business in the first month of the second quarter. Reward the person who brings in the highest amount of sales revenue in April than the others
11. **Winner takes it all:** Organize this as a quarterly contest and encourage your reps to bring in the highest amount of quarterly revenue. At the end of the quarter, the person who succeeds in bringing in the highest amount of revenue wins this contest.
12. **Push your limits:** Focus this contest around getting your reps to push their limits and try to achieve more than the sales targets set for them. Reward everyone who works hard and achieves more than their targets with exciting prizes
13. **High-Five to success:** The name of this contest is inspired from the national high-five day which is celebrated on the 21st of April. Organize this contest and encourage your sales reps to actively upsell and cross-sell to the customers. At the end of the contest period, the person who makes the most significant upsell or cross-sell gets a high-five from the head of the sales department and will be given a reward of his/her choice.

<p>What's in a name?</p>

A lot actually! When we think of successful sport team names, like the New England Patriots or the New York Yankees, we picture the motivated individuals that make up the team. And we envision their dedication to achieving a common goal (i.e., winning a championship.)

In the same way, a good team name for a sales team contributes to the team’s success. Let me explain how:

While one may think of sales team names as a nonessential element of team membership, the fact remains that a relevant and unified sales team names--

* Creates alignment 

* Fosters a sense of unity within a group dynamic

* Helps individuals learn, grow, and reach personal and team goals 

Ultimately, the sense of belonging that comes from being in a group is a powerful component of success, and attaching a name that instills a sense of unity is an important element that sales leaders can leverage. In light of this, we’ve assembled a comprehensive list of 25 sales team name ideas you can use within your sales department. Check them out below:

**1. One Team, One Mission** – This name works well to unite a team and encourage them to work together towards a common goal. You could use this name to motivate your team to work together to achieve a specific sales target for a quarter.

**2. Earning Eagles** – This name can be given to the sales team who are good at bringing in profits consistently. Give them a badge that says Earning Eagles which they can wear proudly to showoff the title they have earned.

**3. The Godfathers** – This is a charismatic sales team that gets any client’s attention quickly and no one can resist them. Here also a badge with the title works perfectly to motivate the team.

**4. Company Builders** – These people are loyal to the company and are the most dedicated workers. Most of this company wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for this sales team. Give them this title and convey to them how important you think they are to your company. This keeps their dedication up and going for a long time.

**5. Seekers** – Give this name to the team that is always searching for the next best deal to offer to the leads. You could also hold a competition where you can challenge the rest of the teams to steal this title form this team.

**6. Hot Shots** – Give this name to the best sales team in your company from whom everybody else can draw inspiration.
 
**7. Caller Ballers** – This is one exceptionally talented sales team while on sales calls.

**8. Cold Call Captains** - This team is exceptionally good at cold calling leads

**9. Fans of Boss** - This team is a fan of their leader/manager and always follow her instructions to win sales

**10. Solution Sellers** - These people have the best and accurate solution to any kind of sales problem. You get the best ideas from them to handle any difficult sales situation

**18. Quota Crushers** - This team never fails to achieve or exceed quota.

**19. Qualifying Leaders** - The team that shows leadership qualities in their day-to-day work deserves this title. They:

  * Are not afraid to take risks

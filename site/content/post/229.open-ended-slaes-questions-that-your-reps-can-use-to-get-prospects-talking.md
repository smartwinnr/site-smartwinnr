Open-ended sales questions are essential to succeed in sales. Why? Because they allow reps to,

* Get inside the heads of their prospects
* Uncover their pain points/needs
* Understand what’s important for them
* Build rapport with them, while uncovering their pain points
* Clearly articulating the value of an offering
* And help them create better futures for themselves

Also by using some great open-ended sales questions your sales reps will be able to disrupt the buyers’ thinking and change their perceptions of what’s true and what’s possible. This, in turn, helps in driving the sale forward and avoiding pitfalls that can derail the sale along the way.

So, here we share some powerful sales questions that'll [put your reps on the path to building rapport](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-can-managers-instill-a-buyer-first-mindset-amongst-their-team-members/) navigating buyer wants, needs, and desires, and ushering sales to the close.

### **Initial questions to build rapport**

These questions come in handy for your reps during their initial conversation with a customer to connect with them and build rapport. These [rapport-building](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/4-techniques-to-build-rapport-virtually/) questions help them to 

* Really get to know their prospects
* [Understand what they want and need](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-can-sales-reps-adopt-a-buyer-first-selling-approach/)
* And figure out how to position your product or service as the perfect solution

Without this level of intimacy, you can’t consult the account. 

**Examples:**

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
    <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <ul>

        <li>What’s going on in your business these days?</li>
        <li>Is it true what they say about living in [city/state]? (For example, 'Is it true what they say about living in L.A.? Are the freeways essentially parking lots?')</li>
        <li>Since you live in [city/state], do you go to [local attraction] all the time?</li>
        <li>I have such good memories of [city/state] — I visited when I was X years old and absolutely loved [destination/feature]. What do you think about [destination/feature]?</li>
        <li>If I had the opportunity to pass through [city/state], what would be your top recommendations?</li>

### **Discovery of needs and pain points**

These questions help your reps to [uncover the pain points](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-active-listening-in-sales/)/ challenges/ needs of the prospects. While posing these need-based or pain-based questions ask your reps to be cognizant of the pains your offering solves. In other words, ask them to not ask about areas that your product or service doesn’t address.

**Examples:**

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
    <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <ul>
        <li>What is the biggest challenge you face with your business today? </li>
        <li>What is the most important priority to you in this and why is that? </li>
        <li>What would you like to see improved? </li>
        <li>What is preventing you from reaching your objectives?</li>
        <li>How is this issue affecting your business?</li>
        <li>Why isn’t your current solution and/or process working for you?</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</div>

### **Qualifying Questions**

Following are the qualifying questions which your reps can use to determine

* A prospect’s interest level
* What do they think of your sales approach so far
* And what your next move should be to close the deal

These questions help them to filter prospects and narrow down their focus to concentrate only on those prospects who have a higher likelihood of getting converted into paying customers

**Examples:**

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
    <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <ul>
        <li>When would you evaluate solutions in [Your Industry/Category]?</li>
        <li>What do you think about our offer so far?</li>
        <li>How would you like to move forward after today?</li>
        <li>Are there any questions about our product that I haven’t answered yet?</li>
        <li>What does your budget look like for this [Project/Product/Service]?</li>
        <li>What changed since the last time we spoke about this?</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</div>

        <li>If you were to make this happen, what would it mean for you personally?</li>
        <li>How would implementing these changes affect your competitiveness in the market?</li>
        <li>What won’t happen if you chose not to move forward with this?</li>

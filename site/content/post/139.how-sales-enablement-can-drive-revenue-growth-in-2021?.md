The priorities of the leadership of a lot of companies changed in the year 2020. The companies have started paying <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/4-best-practices-to-have-a-perfect-sales-enablement-process/" target="_blank" class="ml_custom_link">more attention to their sales enablement needs</a> and this indeed paid them off pretty well.

According to <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/sales-enablement-report?utm_campaign=Sales%20Blog%20-%20Daily%20Manual%20Emails&utm_medium=email&utm_content=103027741&utm_source=hs_email&hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com%2Fsales%2Fsales-enablement-revenue-growth&hubs_post-cta=65%25%20of%20sales%20leaders&_conv_v=vi%3A1*sc%3A62*cs%3A1613015703*fs%3A1607603114*pv%3A128*exp%3A%7B%7D*ps%3A1612971880&_conv_s=si%3A62*sh%3A1613015703219-0.8574540171006035*pv%3A2" target="_blank" class="ml_custom_link">Hubspot’s research,</a> 65% of the sales leaders who have made dedicated and focused sales enablement efforts, have outperformed their sales targets in 2020.

In case you are looking to implement dedicated sales enablement measures at your organization, then now is the right time. As we cruise through 2021, here are 4 ways in which a dedicated sales enablement strategy can help in driving revenue growth in the year 2021

<br>

#### **1. Data-driven sales enablement efforts**

Your sales data is probably the most powerful tool that you have in your toolbox. Extract the crucial sales data regularly. For example, data like,

* How many opportunities are turning into discovery calls?

* How many discovery calls are turning into demos?

* How many demos are turning into proposals

* And how many proposals do we send out that turn into closed businesses

Now analyze this data and inform the managers about,

* The areas where each individual rep is lagging behind 

* The areas where each individual rep needs additional support from their managers

* And the enablement areas where the managers need to focus on in order to yield greater sales results

      This approach helps the sales leaders to know how to support sales managers and reps and provides valuable insight into the type of training and content that would be most effective. This in turn helps a great deal to increase sales revenue.

#### **2.Focus on sales team culture**

Chances are you’re very familiar with the term “sales culture”. The idea that a company should have a shared set of beliefs, values, and practices. But when was the last time you have assessed the culture of your team?

      <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-build-a-successful-sales-environment/" target="_blank" class="ml_custom_link">A good culture in your workspace</a> plays a pivotal role in supporting sales enablement and boosting your sales revenue. So, make sure to create a culture where sales reps,
      <ul>
        <li>Are motivated to learn, work, and innovate</li>
        <li>Have strong communication, rapport, and trust across the sales teams and between the managers (especially true in a remote environment)</li>
        <li>Can communicate openly and freely</li>
        <li>Have the ability to tackle issues immediately as they arise</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

This kind of culture nurtures the development of individuals and the company and helps in boosting revenue

<p>"Communication is the fuel that drives the sales engine", - most often heard by sales reps during their training process. In sales, the ability to communicate effectively serves as a common trait for success. Traditional pitch practice takes time – say 10 minutes per role-play, 5 minutes for review, and another 15 minutes for a re-do. For a team of 10, that's 5 hours of your day; for 20, more than a full workday.</p>

These numbers will worry you. What if you could have AI step into your shoes, providing realistic interaction, offering instant feedback for improvement?

Sales leaders can now enable AI coaching in minutes to streamline onboarding and quickly scale upskilling.

Keep reading, here we will read how AI role-plays can be a time-effective way to increase sales skills.

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">What is AI Role Play?</h3>

We’re all familiar with the standard roleplay process of sales training and development:

* <p>The sales rep and the manager act out a sales scenario.</p>
* <p>The manager evaluates the sales rep’s performance and provides feedback.</p>
* <p>The sales rep applies the feedback received in future sales pitch.</p>

The process is simple. When roleplays are live, the sales rep receives their feedback in real time. But, the questions are:

*	<p>How accurate are these feedback? </p>
*	<p>How consistent is the manager from one roleplay to the next or say from one rep to the next?</p>
*	<p>Are there any form of biases?</p>
*	<p>How scalable is this training process?</p>

**AI role-play** is like a virtual stage for your real-life sales scenarios – be it cold calls, discovery calls, demos, sales pitches or objection handling. Your sales reps get immediate feedback and have the flexibility to practice these scenarios repeatedly.

For both new hires and seasoned reps, leveraging [AI role-play](https://www.smartwinnr.com/product/two-way-ai-role-plays/) proves to be the most effective strategy for real-world calls. It not only facilitates the acquisition of new skills but also works as a stress-reducing and confidence-booster.

Creating AI role-plays is straightforward. Craft prompts tailored to your sales scenarios, upload to SmartWinnr, and let the simulations enhance your team's skills. Simple yet effective!


<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">Importance of AI Role Play for Sales Training</h3>

#### **1. Role of Communication in Sales**

The ability to initiate meaningful conversations with prospects and customers stands as a pivotal factor for achieving success in sales. Emily, joined as a new sales rep for a pharma company. Handling concerns about new medication cost

AI Healthcare Professional: "Emily, our clinic is interested in your new medication, but budget constraints are a major consideration. Can you provide more information on the cost?"

Emily: "I completely understand the financial aspect, especially in the healthcare industry. Let me walk you through the comprehensive benefits our medication brings. While it may have an initial cost, it significantly reduces long-term expenses related to patient care and recovery. How does that align with your budgetary concerns?"

AI Healthcare Professional: "Interesting perspective. However, we still need to ensure it fits within our annual budget."

Emily: "Absolutely. To support your budget, we offer flexible financing options and volume discounts for bulk purchases. This way, you not only provide optimal care but also maximize cost-effectiveness. Would you like more details on these options?"

AI Coach Feedback: "Emily, highlighting long-term benefits and offering flexible financing options demonstrated a strategic approach. The prospect is open to exploring further. Well done!"  prospect expressing concerns about the product's pricing. The sales rep can experiment with various responses, such as emphasizing the product's value, offering discounts, or providing flexible payment options.

#### **2.	Practicing Communication through Role Plays**

Another crucial aspect is practicing the pitches. Lets say Michael, an insurance agent gearing up for a high-stakes negotiation. Traditional training might involve theoretical discussions and hypothetical scenarios, but mastering a sales pitch requires more than theory – it demands practical experience.

AI Policyholder: "Michael, I've been comparing different insurance plans, and they all seem quite similar. What makes your comprehensive plan stand out?" 

Michael: "I appreciate your diligence in researching, and it's crucial to find the right fit. Our comprehensive plan goes beyond the basics. We give coverage not just for standard scenarios but tailored protection for unique situations you might encounter. Just like a personalized safety net. How does that resonate with your coverage expectations?"

AI Policyholder: "Interesting concept. Can you provide an example of a unique scenario your plan covers that others might not?"

Michael: "Certainly! One distinctive feature is our coverage extension for international travel. Most standard plans might not offer this. So, whether it's a business trip or a vacation, you remain protected. Would you find value in having that additional layer of security?"

AI Coach Feedback: "Michael, linking a personalized safety net to unique coverage features was a persuasive strategy. The prospect is intrigued by the international travel extension. Keep up the excellent work!"

The AI, acting as a coach or evaluator, provides instant feedback on each interaction. This feedback loop becomes a catalyst for continuous improvement. This allows reps to understand the impact of their communication choices and learn from errors.

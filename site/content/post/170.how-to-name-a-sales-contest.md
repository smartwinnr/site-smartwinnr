A sales contest is typically a brainchild of yours. You invest a significant amount of time and effort to [create](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/design-sales-contest-for--new-product-launch/) it. So, it’s equally important to give this child a good name. Because the [contest’s name](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/top-20-sales-contest-names/) is the first thing that is going to captivate your audience and attract them towards your contest.

You must be having a lot of names and words floating in your mind that might make a sweet name for your contest. But in order to make your contest’s name really impactful, you need to keep the following things in mind while going about naming your contest.


<br>

## **1. Keep it simple and easy to remember**
    

Simplicity can be the best policy to attract the audience. So make sure that you come up with a name that is,

-   Simple
    
-   Sounds cool
    
-   Short (not too lengthy)
    
-   Easy to pronounce
    
-   Gets registered in your audiences’ minds easily (so that they remember it)
    

  

The lesser the complexity of the name, the better it connects with your people

<br>

## **2. Make sure that the name is goal-oriented**
    

The name has to be aligned with the [goal/s that you want to achieve through the sales contest](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/kpi-gamification-how-to-select-kpis/). It has to reinforce the purpose of the contest and motivate the reps to achieve the contest’s objective whenever they take the name.

  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
   <p> Here are some examples of goal-oriented sales contest names:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b> Fish for leads -</b> This name motivates people to bring in more leads </li> 
      <li> <b>Race for referrals -</b> This one motivates people to bring in referrals </li>
      <li> <b>Close now, Wine later -</b> This motivates people to close more deals </li>
      <li> <b>Show me the money -</b> This is to motivate people to generate more revenue </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<br>  

## **3. Make sure that the name is attached to a theme or real-life event**
    

Remember that a name is the first thing that you use to introduce your sales contest to your audience. So it needs to be catchy and it should generate excitement amongst the audience about the contest.

  

The best way to give a catchy name to your [contest is by attaching it to an exciting theme or a real-life event that already has a lot of buzz around it](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-design-a-march-madness-contest-for-a-larger-team/).

  
<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">

## **4. Use industry-relevant terms**
    

Using industry-relevant terms in your contest name makes it much more relatable to your sales reps as they come across these terms regularly and use them in their daily life.

  
<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">

        <li> <b> Call Centers -</b> First call premier league, Acing ACW </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<br>  

## **5. Make sure that the name sounds good when said aloud**
    

Sometimes, a name looks good when it is written on paper but sounds awkward when it is said aloud. So, after developing a name, test it to see whether it sounds good or bad when it is said out loud.

Secondly, make sure that it is not confusing or tongue-twisting. If it is, don’t hesitate to think about any other name for your sales contest.

<br>

## **6. Have multiple options and get feedback on the name**
    

By keeping the above points in mind, come up with at least 5 name options for your sales contest. Then test these names by taking feedback from everyone in the sales department.

  

Ask them to vote for the name that they like or suggest a name of their own if they do not like any of your suggested names. Then finalize the name that receives more votes. This can as well be the 1st activity of the sales contest. Participant feel a oneness with the the contest, which they have helped to name!

<br>

## **7. Take expert help if needed**
    

Creating a catchy name for a sale contest is not an easy task. It demands an ample amount of time and effort.

So, don’t think of this process as a walk in the park. In case, you have failed to develop an interesting name for your sales contest, then it will be a good idea to take help.

One way is to go for a naming firm that would help you develop effective sales contest names. But remember that this is an expensive option as the naming firms usually charge thousands of dollars.

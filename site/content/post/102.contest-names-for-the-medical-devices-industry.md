A day in the life of a medical sales representative can be long and challenging. But also incredibly rewarding. 

It takes a great deal of effort from salespeople to:

* Book meetings with the HCPs

* Cope with the ever-changing customers’ needs

* Be well versed with their products, services, policies, etc

* Be up-to-date with the latest advancements

To keep up with all this, they need to be resilient, persistent, and motivated each and every day.

Sales contests make for a fun and innovative way to continuously: 

* Motivate your reps 

* Improve their knowledge and skills

Here is a list of cool, creative, and catchy sales contest names for the medical devices industry.

### **Contests to Train your Salespeople**

<div class="ml-margin-left10">
  <p><span class="ml_text_bold"> 1. Contest Alley: </span>Conduct a quiz contest every week to <span class="ml_highlighted_text">improve knowledge of products</span> and other related areas.</p>
  <p><span class="ml_text_bold"> 2. Pitch Perfect: </span>Conduct a video coaching contest once every month. Pick one product each month. Ask your reps to give a demo of that product - either on its features and benefits or on setup and installation. Whoever delivers the most <span class="ml_highlighted_text">effective sales pitch</span> wins the competition. </p>
  <p><span class="ml_text_bold"> 3. Grey’s Anatomy: </span>This contest is named after the famous TV show “Grey’s Anatomy”. Run this quiz contest once every month. Focus it around building a fluent <span class="ml_highlighted_text">knowledge of human anatomy and physiology</span> amongst your salespeople.</p>
  <p><span class="ml_text_bold"> 4. Storytelling Contest: </span><span class="ml_highlighted_text">Sales and storytelling</span> is a powerful combination. Rather than listing all the features and benefits of a product-- it is more effective if the salesperson tells a success story to the HCP. Conduct a video coaching contest and encourage your sales reps to pitch a product by telling an effective story about it. The rep who delivers the most interesting, relatable, and engaging story, wins the competition.</p>

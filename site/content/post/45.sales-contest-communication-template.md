Are you planning to implement a sales contest for your sales department? At a minimum, you’ll need to follow these 3 vital rules:

1. Stay on top of communications, so your team keeps the competition top of mind. 

2. Communicate all the contest rules simply and clearly, so that your team understands how to win.

3. Mention the rewards that the winners of the contest are going to receive. This sparks the interest of the contestants and motivates them to participate in the contest.

Following these rules to communicate your contest effectively with your participants prior to its launch. If you are using email communication at your office, then here is a template you can use to effectively announce the launch of your next contest.

Credit card sales is tough. It involves a lot of:

* Cold calling

* Rejections

* Verifying documents

* Processing applications

* Supporting customers with their credit card related queries

You need to make sure that regardless of this tough process, your reps keep trying enthusiastically to win more sales.

An innovative way to do this is-- by running engaging contests around credit card sales activities.

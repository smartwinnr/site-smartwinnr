“**What you can’t measure, you can’t manage**”, goes a popular saying. And in sales, it has become clear that you can’t manage your salesforce if you can’t measure their performance.  Research shows that people who set goals and track them regularly are more likely to achieve them. Similarly, tracking the sales rep’s activities leads to higher performance. A scorecard is a great tool to track a sales rep’s performance in real-time. These scorecards help in..

* Keeping your sales reps accountable

* Evaluating your sales process

* Identifying top performers

* And creating healthy competition

Not keeping score in your sales department is the same as not keeping score in sports. A sales scorecard informs reps what they could have done differently in the past to get positive results. It enables them to see where they stand against their goals and what they need to do to achieve them. 

That’s why it is important that modern sales leaders empower themselves and their sales team with scorecards that help in boosting their sales rep’s performance. Below are the steps to create a perfect sales scorecard for your sales team:

<br>

### **Steps to create a Sales Scorecard**

#### **1. Identify scorecard metrics**

Your organization might be tracking a lot of important business-related metrics. But a scorecard efficiently reveals the metrics that are important for the sales reps to improve their field performance. Determine what metrics you are going to track and measure using scorecards.

If you have multiple roles, create a scorecard for each one of them. For example, sales development scorecard might include metrics such as calls, conversations, emails, and sales accepted opportunities. And, an account executive scorecard would likely have metrics like meetings, demos, proposals sent and closed-won.

The metrics you choose should be relevant to the sales reps role and guide their everyday behavior. Tracking only the most important activities helps the reps in prioritizing their tasks.

<br>

#### **2. Calculate metric goals**

Reverse engineer your sales process and set the goals for your sales team. Start with the amount of revenue you need to bring in for this fiscal quarter.

For example, let’s say that you need to make $10 million this quarter, and your average deal size is $1 million. You need to close 10 deals. Assuming your team closes a quarter of the proposals sent out, you’ll need 40 proposals. If you know that every one out of five meetings gets to the proposal stage, you’re going to need 200 meetings. And if every 10 phone calls result in one meeting, then reps should make 2,000 calls this quarter.  

Also, consider adding cushion to your goal. Adding an extra 15-25 percent to your activity numbers ensures that you’ll get to your larger goals. Just make sure that the activity numbers are still achievable.

<br>

#### **3. Break down metrics by timeframe**

Break down sales rep’s field activities on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Then, set goals for those activities to achieve in the below way:

<table class="table-bordered table-striped ml-margin-bottom10">
  <thead class="">
    <tr>
      <th class="padding5">Activity</th>
      <th class="padding5">Per Quarter</th>
      <th class="padding5">Per Month</th>
      <th class="padding5">Per Week</th>
      <th class="padding5">Per Day</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody class="">
    <tr>
      <td class="padding5">Deals</td>
      <td class="padding5">11</td>
      <td class="padding5">5</td>
      <td class="padding5">1</td>
      <td class="padding5">N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="padding5">Proposals Sent</td>
      <td class="padding5">60</td>
      <td class="padding5">16</td>
      <td class="padding5">6</td>
      <td class="padding5">1</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td class="padding5">Meetings</td>
      <td class="padding5">150</td>
      <td class="padding5">70</td>
      <td class="padding5">20</td>
      <td class="padding5">4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Some metrics don’t make sense to track on a daily basis because they won’t happen that frequently. Like, ‘Deals’ in the above table.

<br>

#### **4. Assign the metrics to reps and managers**

Divide the scorecard metrics by the number of reps in your sales team. For instance, if you have 10 sales reps you could divide the metrics in the following way:

<table class="table-bordered table-striped ml-margin-bottom10">
  <thead class="">
    <tr>
      <th class="padding5">Activity</th>
      <th class="padding5">Goal</th>
      <th class="padding5">Timeframe</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody class="">
    <tr>
      <td class="padding5">Deals</td>
      <td class="padding5">1</td>
      <td class="padding5">Per Quarter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="padding5">Proposals Sent</td>
      <td class="padding5">3</td>
      <td class="padding5">Per Month</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td class="padding5">Meetings</td>
      <td class="padding5">3</td>
      <td class="padding5">Per Week</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

A manager’s scorecard is the composite of her team’s metrics and looks like this:

<table class="table-bordered table-striped ml-margin-bottom10">
  <thead class="">
    <tr>
      <th class="padding5">Activity</th>
      <th class="padding5">Goal</th>
      <th class="padding5">Timeframe</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody class="">
    <tr>
      <td class="padding5">Deals</td>
      <td class="padding5">10</td>
      <td class="padding5">Per Quarter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="padding5">Proposals Sent</td>
      <td class="padding5">30</td>
      <td class="padding5">Per Month</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td class="padding5">Meetings</td>
      <td class="padding5">32</td>
      <td class="padding5">Per Week</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

#### **5. Track and review**

This enables you to keep goals on pace and course-correct performance when metrics fall behind. The table below shows the tracking of the scorecard metrics:

<table class="table-bordered table-striped ml-margin-bottom10">
  <thead class="">
    <tr>
      <th class="padding5">Activity</th>
      <th class="padding5">Completed</th>
      <th class="padding5">Total</th>
      <th class="padding5">Goal</th>
      <th class="padding5">% to Goal</th>
      <th class="padding5">On Pace?</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody class="">
    <tr>
      <td class="padding5">Conversations</td>
      <td class="padding5">14</td>
      <td class="padding5">42</td>
      <td class="padding5">40</td>
      <td class="padding5">105%</td>
      <td class="padding5">Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="padding5">Opportunities Created</td>
      <td class="padding5">3</td>
      <td class="padding5">8</td>
      <td class="padding5">10</td>
      <td class="padding5">80%</td>
      <td class="padding5">N</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td class="padding5">Wins</td>
      <td class="padding5">2</td>
      <td class="padding5">3</td>
      <td class="padding5">2</td>
      <td class="padding5">75%</td>
      <td class="padding5">N</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Make sure that you review these metrics daily. Make this data part of your weekly one-on-one sessions. Also, have the sales managers use this data to determine where their team members need coaching.

**Final words:** When created and implemented correctly, sales scorecards are highly effective in driving your revenue through a metrics-driven sales approach.

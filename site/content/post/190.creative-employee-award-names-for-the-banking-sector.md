How do you recognize the achievements of your bank staff? Probably by

* Giving them bonus
* Sponsoring their holidays
* Or giving expensive gifts like smart gadgets, apparel, etc

While these things will definitely make them happy, what actually makes a lasting impact on them is an award that has a special title describing their achievement. Because an award is something that they can place on their desk to showcase their achievements to their colleagues. This encourages not just the achiever to achieve even more, but also encourages her peers to try to win these awards

But a simple “Employee of the month” award won’t do. You need to come up with some creative award names that will capture your employees’ attention and instill motivation in them to win those awards

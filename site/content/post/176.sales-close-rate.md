### **What is a Close Rate?**

In sales, the close rate is the ratio of sales opportunities that are closed-won vs. the total sales opportunities created during a specific period of time. \

Close rate is a valuable [KPI](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/kpi-gamification-how-to-select-kpis/) in sales. It gives you insights into,

* How effective is your lead generation strategy?
* Is your pipeline healthy (without getting dried up or backlogging prospects at any stage)?
* How efficient is your sales team in closing sales?
* How well is your [sales process](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-measure-and-improve-the-effectiveness-of-your-sales-process/) working?

### **Why is Close Rate important in Sales?**

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>Close rate helps you to determine,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How many new sales opportunities need to be created</li>
      <li>And how many sales deals need to be closed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>in a given month, quarter, or year to achieve your businesses’ sales and revenue goals.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p> Once you determine an overall close rate for your business for a particular time period, you can create individualized targets for each one of your sales reps based on their capabilities.</p>
  </div>
</div>

\

For example, you can set a target for a sales rep that in a month

* He needs to generate 10 new opportunities
* And close at least 3 deals

\

<div class="ml_pro_tip ml-margin-bottom20">
  <span class="ml_text_bold">Pro-tip:</span> You can let the super-efficient closers in your team to generate fewer opportunities and focus more on closing the already generated opportunities as closing deals is their forte. On the other hand, encourage the less efficient closers in your team to have more opportunities in their pipeline as this might help them to achieve their target.

### **What does a good sales Close Rate look like in various industries?**

A good close rate is highly dependent on your product, service, and industry. So before we get into numbers, don’t be alarmed if your sales organization isn’t meeting the benchmarks for your perceived field. Moreover, the truth is that even the best sales reps on the best sales teams in the world will only win a fraction of their sales opportunities.\

So, here is a table that shows the average conversion rate across various B2B industries\
<br>

<table class="table-bordered table-striped ml-margin-bottom10">
  <thead class="">
    <tr>
      <th class="padding5 ml_text_bold">Industry</th>
      <th class="padding5 ml_text_bold">Average Conversion Rate</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody class="">
    <tr>
      <td class="padding5">Computer Product Manufacturing</td>
      <td class="padding5">1.1%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="padding5">B2B Software/ SaaS</td>
      <td class="padding5">1.1%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="padding5">Commercial Insurance</td>

### **What is the formula for calculating the close rate?**

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>The formula for calculating close rate is:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top20 ml-margin-bottom20 text-center">
    <p> <b>Closed Won Deals / Opportunities Created</b> </p>
  </div>
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>For example, if a salesperson creates 10 opportunities and wins 3, their close rate is 30% because 3 Closed Won Deals / 10 Opportunities Created = 30%.</p>
  </div>
</div>

\

To properly calculate the close rate, you’ll need both those data points to come from between the same period of time. To give you an example of what we mean by between the same period, let’s pretend we’re calculating the close rate for all of Q1. We would need to take all the deals that are closed-won in Q1 (regardless of whether they were created in Q1 or prior) divided by all the opportunities created during Q1.\

Easy as that!

### **How to improve your sales close rate?**

  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p> <b>Improve your prospect qualification process: </b> Successful sales organizations have a “protect the pipeline” mentality. Sales leadership should enforce strict qualification criteria, using BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) or a similar process. Qualifying <a href="">prospects</a> before they enter your pipeline (prior to becoming an opportunity), will result in a positive impact in close rate.</p>
    <p> <b>Improve your sales Process:</b> Identify areas in the sales process where opportunities are converting at the lowest rate. </p>
    <p>A sales process is made up of stages. Hunt for trends where stage progression is at its lowest. If you uncover a poor stage progression trend, develop & implement a plan to remedy it. </p>
    <p><b>Improve the closing skills of your salespeople: </b> Let’s say you haven’t found an issue in lead qualification or noticeable breakdown in your stage conversion, then turn your focus to sharpening your sales reps’ selling and <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/puppy-dog-close-technique-let-your-customers-experience-your-brand-personally/">closing techniques</a>. There is nothing worse than finding viable prospects, spending time with them throughout the sales process, only to have them not buy your product or service. So, work closely with your sales reps on creating a more effective selling and closing strategy.</p>

Welcome to the third part in the series of blogs on on-the-spot training. In case you haven’t read the first two parts, we recommend that you read (links provided below)
  
* [On-the-spot training part-1: How to plan and organize an on-the-spot training](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/on-the-spot-training-part-1-how-to-plan-and-organize-on-the-spot-training/)
* [On-the-spot training part-2:Framework of on-the-spot training](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/on-the-spot-training-part-2-the-framework-of-on-the-spot-training/)

In this third part, we are going to look at some of the benefits that you get by adopting the on-the-spot training:

\
\

### **Benefits of on-the-spot training**\
\

#### **1. Engages the learners effectively**

On-the-spot training doesn’t just make the learners sit through a [lengthy PowerPoint presentation](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/transform-your-2-day-face-to-face-training-into-a-microsoft-teams-virtual-training/) for hours together. It doesn’t promote having just one-sided communication. It facilitates,

* Two-way communication between the trainer and the trainees
* Keeps the training sessions smaller and to the point
* Focuses on imparting knowledge on not more than one topic in each session
* Creates an enjoyable training environment by engaging the learners in some fun activities like pop-up [quizzes](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/gamified-assessments/), games, surveys, opinion polls, etc in between the training sessions

This way on-the-spot training [keeps your learners engaged in the training sessions.](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/drive-engagement-in-remote-learning-in-workplaces/)

\
\

#### **2. Drives self-motivation amongst the learners to learn**

On-the-spot training environment facilitates a free, lively, and interactive learning environment where the learners are free to 

* Interact with their trainers and ask questions as and when they arise
* Seek additional information on a specific topic
* Practice different skills in a fun way with their peers and the trainer
* Take tests and [coaching](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/best-practices-to-drive-video-coaching/) to self-assess their knowledge and skills. And then make efforts to improve themselves

This sort of [training environment](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/learning-disrupte-how-to-upskill-your-global-sales-team-in-this-post-pandemic-virtual-environment/) drives self-motivation amongst the learners to 

* Attend these training sessions
* Obtain as much knowledge as possible 
* And develop themselves as good professionals 

\
\

#### **3. Helps in building a strong team**

On-the-spot training specifically helps a new batch of recruits to form good strong bonds amongst themselves in a very short span of time. This is because on-the-spot training gets them to
* Network with each other 
* Discuss various training topics
* Face tests and challenges together
* And participate in a lot of fun activities together 

This helps a great deal in strengthening the bond between them and as a result creating a stronger team.

\
\

#### **4. Reinforces knowledge**

Research shows that the employees forget 75% of all the information that they have learned within 24 hours after their training. But on-the-spot training helps in cementing the information into your learners’ minds by [regularly reinforcing crucial information](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/improve-knowledge-proficiency-by-21-percent-through-knowledge-reinforcement/) through, 

* Quizzes
* [Microlearning content](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/spaced-repetition-and-microlearning-two-peas-in-a-pod/)
* On-demand content
* [Coaching assignments](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-coach-your-salespeople-into-sales-champions/) etc

These help the learners to revisit and recall whatever they have learned on a regular basis and retain that information for a longer period of time

\
\

#### **5. Helps the managers/ trainers to analyze the employee’s performance**

Since on-the-spot training is completely run through [digital platforms](https://www.smartwinnr.com/), it makes it very easy for the trainers to track the progress of each and every employee in their team. They can instantly get insights into each rep’s understanding of a particular topic and their knowledge and skill levels by analyzing,

* Their performance in the quizzes
* Their responses in the [surveys](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/survey-questions-to-ask-your-sales-team-before-new-product-launch-training/) and opinion polls
* Their performance in [role-plays](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/5-sales-role-play-games-that-prepares-your-team-to-win/) and coaching assignments

These insights help the trainers to uncover any knowledge and skills gaps amongst their trainees and provide appropriate coaching to cover them

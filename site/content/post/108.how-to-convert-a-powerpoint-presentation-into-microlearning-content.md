### **PowerPoint Presentation: A thing of the past**

Don’t get this wrong. Microsoft power-point is undoubtedly the most powerful tool to present information in many creative ways. It’s been around since 1987 and been producing 30 million presentations every day. But when it comes to training, it is perhaps not the most optimal tool. 

Sure, it is effective for instructor-led training sessions. But to make that training stick, you need something more than just a ppt. 

Training has evolved so much from the 1980s to today. Now, with workplaces filled with the <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/microlearning-an-effective-way-to-train-millennials/'" target="_blank" class="ml_custom_link">millennial</a> workforce, you <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/microlearning-as-a-supplement-for-lms/" target="_blank" class="ml_custom_link">need a supplement</a> that caters to:

* Shorter attention spans

* Just-in-time learning needs

* Better retention rate

* And other aspects of quality learning

Wondering what you could use as a supplement? 

**Microlearning** is the key.

<br>

### **What is Microlearning?**

<a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/spaced-repetition-and-microlearning-two-peas-in-a-pod/" target="_blank" class="ml_custom_link">Microlearning</a> is the process of breaking down lengthy training content into smaller nuggets. Converting those nuggets into interesting formats like infographics, videos, podcasts, etc, and delivering them to the learner regularly through mobile app or desktop. This method of learning helps the learners to:

* Digest the information quickly and easily

* Improves their knowledge retention

* Enables them to learn anytime, anywhere

So, in order to supplement your training and meet the training needs of Gen Z learners-- you can convert your PowerPoint training content into microlearning feeds. Here are some helpful ways to convert.

<br>

#### **1. Infographics**

Do you know that-- “a good infographic is worth a thousand word”? That’s the power infographics carry. Visual representation of information helps in capturing your audiences’ attention. 

Go through your training presentation and convert any of the following into beautiful and intuitive infographics:

* bullet points, 

* statistical data, 

* comparisons, 

* timelines, 

* hierarchies

<div class="ml_special_div_blog">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content">
    <p>If you don’t want to get into the effort of creating an infographic, you can also present a slide itself as an infographic provided the content is short and crisp. Remember that ‘micro’ is key here. The intention should be to get the learners to focus on small pieces of information at a time.</p>

</ul>

#### **2. Videos**

Videos are everywhere nowadays!  YouTube viewers consume more than a billion hours of videos per day!  And more than half of YouTube’s views come from mobile devices.  

How did this number of views get so high? Quite simply. These videos are easy to access and they maintain viewers’ attention. So, why not use them in your learning as well to effectively engage your learners?

<div class="ml_special_div_blog">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_title ml_text_bold">Here is how to convert the training content PPT into videos: </div>
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content">
    <p><span class="ml_text_bold">1.</span> Pick a concept in the ppt which you want to convert into a video.</p>
    <p><span class="ml_text_bold">2.</span> Club all the slides that explain that concept in a separate ppt.</p>
    <p><span class="ml_text_bold">3.</span> Then add PowerPoint features like animations, transitions, and audio to the slides in order to add movement to the presentation.</p>
    <p><span class="ml_text_bold">4.</span> You can also choose to add narration to each slide. This helps to engage the learners more effectively since they aren’t reduced to only reading the slides. </p>
  </div>
</div>

Another way to create these videos is by using video creation tools that are available in the market. They help in generating some awesome videos/ animated videos within no time. 

**Best Tools for Creating Videos:**

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.moovly.com/" target="_blank">Moovly</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://animoto.com/" target="_blank">Animoto</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.toonly.com/" target="_blank">Toonly</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.animaker.com/" target="_blank">Animaker</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="ml_pro_tip ml-margin-bottom20">
  <p><span class="ml_text_bold">Pro-Tip:</span> Here are certain guidelines to follow in order to create highly engaging videos: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Follow a well-defined structure while presenting the information in the video. Make sure that the content flows seamlessly</li>
    <li>Add screenshots, images, and, animations wherever you can</li>
    <li>According to research from various social media platforms-- viewers’ engagement with the videos drops sharply after 2-3 minutes. So, make sure that your microlearning videos are no more than 2 minutes. Preferably 60 seconds.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<br>

#### **3. Podcasts**

In this fast-paced world, your learners do not have the time to keep up with the latest updates and trends of their industry. So you need to create content which they can consume on the go. 

This is where podcasts come into the picture. Podcasts or audio files provide an efficient way for the learners to listen and learn while

* They are commuting to home on the train

* At the gym

* While running errands

* While working from home 

It doesn’t take much to develop these podcasts. 

<div class="ml_special_div_blog">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_title ml_text_bold">Every month, invite an expert to talk on a topic for 5-10 minutes. Topics can be varied like </div>
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content">
    <ul>
      <li>The market landscape</li>
      <li>Industry trends</li>
      <li>Compliance and policies</li>
      <li>Current sales trends</li>
  </div>
</div>

Record the talk using the podcast record tools mentioned below and send the audio file to the learners on their mobile devices. 

Some best tools to record podcasts:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank">Skype</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/" target="_blank">Garage Band</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="ml_pro_tip ml-margin-bottom20">
  <p><span class="ml_text_bold">Pro-Tip:</span> Occasionally, you can do podcast series featuring industry experts. Or get some famous personalities to deliver a motivational talk. This way you will be able to excite and engage your audience effectively with your podcasts. </p>
</div>

<br>

#### **4. Storyboards**

We all have enjoyed comic books as children and some of us still do. What makes comic books special?

* The animations

* And the presentation of the story in the form of a storyboard

You can spark the same nostalgic emotion and engagement amongst your learners by introducing storyboards in their learning. 

<div class="ml_special_div_blog">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_title ml_text_bold">Here are some topics which are suitable for converting into storyboards: </div>
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content">
    <ul>
      <li>Sales Conversations</li>
      <li>Workflows</li>
      <li>Standard operating procedures</li>
      <li>Ideal customer conversations</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

### **Bring everything together: The Heart-Head-Hands Technique**

Now let’s look at an interesting technique called “Heart-Head-Hands”. This technique provides a framework to organize and send your microlearning modules. This helps in maximizing the interest of the learners and their knowledge retention. 

Here is how the technique works:

* **Heart**: This is the emotional hook that you need to establish at the beginning (before sending the actual training content). Try to get the learner to care about what you have to say by striking an emotional chord with them. Send microlearning feeds on:

  * What topics you are going to cover in the next one week or 15 days

  * What knowledge are you are trying to reinforce

  * What outcome do you expect out of it

  * What is in it for them
 
    **What to use**: Infographics and videos
 
* **Head**: This is where you provide the learners with the actual training content. Send one microlearning feed every day or once in 3 days. Make sure not to overwhelm your learners by limiting to only one concept per microlearning.
 
    **What to use**: Infographics, videos, and podcasts
 
* **Hands**: Finally, wrap things up by reinforcing practical knowledge. Send feeds on: 

  * Real-life scenarios

  * Realistic customer conversation examples

  * Appropriate actions that should be taken in various work scenarios

  * How to apply a concept they have learned in a realistic scenario etc

    This provides hands-on knowledge to your learners.
  
    **What to use**: Storyboard

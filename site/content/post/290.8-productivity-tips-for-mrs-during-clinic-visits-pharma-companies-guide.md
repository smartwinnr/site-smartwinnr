<p>Do you like waiting? Probably not! But for MRs, waiting is a regular part of the job. Let’s break it down for each clinic visits: </p>
<ul>
<li><p> Say an MR needs to visit three doctors in a day.</p> </li>

<li><p> Each visit might involve a waiting time of 10-15 minutes, totaling 30-45 minutes. </P></li>

<li><p> Add in the time taken to commute between clinics—another 30 minutes or more. </p></li>

<li><p> Now, multiply that by 10 MRs, each visiting three doctors. That’s 300-450 minutes—or about 5-7.5 hours—of unproductive time in just one day! </p></li>
</ul>


<p>While MRs might not be too concerned about this downtime, pharmaceutical companies are. These idle moments could mean missed opportunities. But what if this waiting period could be turned into an opportunity? </p>


<p>For pharma companies, we have outlined a few ways like pharma sales training to make the most of their MR’s non-productive time. But first, let’s look at some common challenges. </p>

 

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20"> Common Challenges During Clinic Visits </h3>
<ul>
<li><p><b> Unpredictable wait times:</b> Appointment schedules are often subject to change, leading to unexpected delays.</p> </li>

<li><p> <b>Limited face-time with doctors:</b> Busy schedules restrict interaction time, making it crucial for MRs to maximize every moment. </p></li>

<li><p><b>Competition for doctor's attention:</b> Multiple MRs competing for the same limited time can be overwhelming.</p> </li>

 </ul>

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">How can MRs turn waiting time into productive outcomes? </h3>

<p><b>1. Plan the Day</b></p>

<p>While waiting, MRs should take a moment to organize the rest of their day. Review schedule, confirm upcoming appointments, and prioritize tasks. A well-structured day helps to ensure MRs make the most of their time in the field. </p>

<p><b> 2. Practice the Pitch </b></p>

<p>Instead of waiting, MRs can rehearse their pitch. Not just in their head but with AI-powered <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/upskill-your-sales-team-with-ai-role-play-revolution/" target="_blank" class=""> sales role play.</a> These virtual pharma sales training sessions helps them well articulate product messaging and prepare for any tough questions.

<p><b>3.Build Relationships</b></p>

<p>MRs can use this time to chat with the clinic staff. A friendly conversation can make their future clinic visits smoother.  </p>

<p>---Ask about their day.</p>

<p>---Show interest in their work </p>

<p>-- Discover more information about doctors </p>

<p>---Discuss the latest trends in healthcare. </p>

<p><b>4.Re-certification</b></p>

<p>Waiting time is perfect for brushing up on one’s knowledge. Whether it’s reviewing product information or going through the latest training materials. Re-certifying through sales role play keeps skills sharp, ensures you are always ready to provide accurate and helpful information. </p>

<p><b> 5.Review your Strategy </b></p>

<p>Take a moment to mentally prepare. What are your key points? How can you address potential objections? Is your iPad ready for the detailing? Reviewing your strategy ensures that when you finally get face time with the doctor, you are ready to make the most of it. </p>

<p><b> 6.Engage in Quick Learning (Micro learning) </b></p>

<p>MRs should consider using the downtime for quick learning online. Listen to podcasts, watch short educational videos, or read articles that can improve their sales techniques and even product knowledge.  </p>

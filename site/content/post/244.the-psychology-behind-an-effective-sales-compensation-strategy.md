A [sales compensation strategy](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/best-practices-to-design-your-sales-incentive-plan/) is the backbone of employee motivation in any organization. However, while crafting a compensation strategy, most organizations ignore the psychological aspects that can contribute towards creating a good compensation strategy.

So, in this blog, we would like to bring to your notice,

* How psychology can help us understand what motivates people? 
* And in turn, how can we use that information to design and implement great [sales compensation](https://www.performio.co/insight/sales-commission-glossary) plans? 

\

### **What is Compensation Strategy and What does it Entail?**

A [compensation strategy](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/best-practices-to-implement-a-sales-incentive-plan/) is typically a formal document that explains what an organization has to offer its employees in return for their time, energy, and skills that they give working for that organization. It establishes the organization's overall position on various types of compensation it offers to its employees. It also emphasizes various pay components in the total rewards package.

An ideal compensation strategy should clearly communicate the following to the employees regarding their pay

* What would be their base pay according to their role and position?
* How does it compare to the external competitive market?
* What are various pay programs that they can utilize?
* How can they earn various additional incentives or bonuses?
* What benefits can they avail?
* And information about how commission and incentive plans will be administered

In addition to this, the employees must also be informed about other facilities that the company is going to provide. Like,

* Free training programs
* Mentorship programs
* Technology 
* Growth opportunities etc

### **Key questions to consider when developing a compensation strategy**

Ask yourself these questions before you begin developing your [compensation strategy](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/why-is-it-necessary-to-automate-your-sales-incentive-compensation/):

* How does your organization intend to pay your employees compared to your competitors (above market level, at the market level, or below the market level)?
* How does your organization intend to factor in and leverage variable pay, especially compared to the competitive marketplace? 
* How will health and welfare benefits affect the design of your compensation strategy?
* Can or should a rich benefit offering offset the level of base salary offered?
* Are there positions in the organization that require a different pay strategy, because the role is critical to organizational success, or the skillset is scarce?

### **Psychological aspects that you need to consider in order to draft an effective Sales Compensation strategy**

Here are two famous psychological theories which are crucial to consider in order to draft an [effective sales compensation strategy](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-gamification-can-help-to-take-your-incentive-plan-to-a-whole-new-level/)

\
\

### **Herzberg Theory**

One of the best psychological theories that plays a crucial role in drafting a good sales compensation is perhaps the work that [Frederick Herzberg did in the 1960s.](https://www.cheshnotes.com/2016/10/herzbergs-two-factor-theory-motivation/) He proposed a two-factor theory of motivation, which is better known as intrinsic versus extrinsic. According to this theory, there are a set of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that would lead to increased employee satisfaction.

Herzberg argued that extrinsic factors were the most important ones in the workplace. These are the “hygienic factors” that drive job satisfaction and motivate employees in the workplace.

Extrinsic motivation factors include:

* Job security
* Salary
* Bonuses
* Fringe benefits
* Work conditions
* Paid insurance
* Vacation
* Supervision

These are the most important factors on any job site. If these factors are not present, there will be employee dissension and dissatisfaction.

Intrinsic factors, on the other hand, are the less tangible employee needs.

Intrinsic motivational factors include:

* Challenges
* Recognitions
* Vital responsibilities
* Meaningful work
* Involvement/ Engagement
* Prominence
 
These are also important elements for any manager to focus on to motivate his or her employees. The focus on intrinsic factors has become more popular in the workplace over the last few decades. While not as important as the extrinsic factors, intrinsic factors help to create added job satisfaction.

### **Maslow’s hierarchy of needs**

Another psychological theory that we need to consider while developing our compensation strategy is ***Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs***. Do you remember the pyramid that we have all studied in Psych 101? Yup, we’re bringing that back– but this time, we’re putting a little spin on it with respect to the compensation strategy.

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs was revolutionary in the field of psychology. Up until this point in history, the primary focus of psychology was on human behavior, reactions, and thought patterns in existing circumstances. Maslow, however, looked beyond human experience and started to formulate a framework to unlock human potential and understand human motivation. Thus, Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs was born.

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs explains human motivation as it relates to the pursuit of specific needs. This theory asserts that humans are hardwired to pursue and achieve the most basic needs first and then, later, move on to pursue and achieve more advanced needs (as shown in the picture below).

Now based on this theory, let's see how we can use both intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors in each slab of this pyramid in order to create a motivational sales compensation plan

\
\

### **Basic needs of the employees**

This is for your newly hired sales reps. At this stage, you need to use more of the intrinsic motivational factors and less of extrinsic motivation:

* **Best Onboarding Programs:** Sales reps that go through the best [onboarding programs](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-run-the-new-hire-onboarding-process-remotely/) get to productive 3.4 months sooner than the reps who go through weaker onboarding programs. So make sure that you put them through a good [onboarding program](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/30-60-90-days-gamified-sales-training-plan/).

* **Continuous and Effective Training Programs:** Providing continuous training can result in up to 50% higher net sales per employee. So, make sure that you put your employees through a continuous training program.

* **Good Sales Technology:** Since most operations are remote right now, having a stack of best sales technology is paramount for your reps to succeed in the current environment. 76% of salespeople cite technology as “Critical” or “Extremely Critical” to closing deals

\
\

### **Safety and Security Needs of the employees**

This is the stage where you need to fulfill the safety and security needs of your employees. To do this, you need to drive a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors.

* **A Competitive base salary:** Make sure that you provide a competitive base salary for your employees. (The average  base pay for a sales rep going into 2022 is $47,500 a year)

* **Visibility into their earning:** Make sure that you share adequate compensation data with your employees from time to time

* **Open communication + Feedback:** Make sure that you provide open communication and consistent feedback in order to ensure that your reps know whether they’re good job or not. This pushes them to consistently make efforts to improve themselves. 

\
\

### **Love and Belonging Needs**

This slab again requires you to push the following intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors:
 
* **Company Culture:** 46% of employees report that company culture is very important to them when choosing to apply at a company. So, make sure that you provide a good work environment and culture for your employees at your organization

* **Additional Benefits:** In the U.S, 20% of working adults say that if their organization sponsors their healthcare, child care, or travel, they would feel more connected with the company. So it would be a good idea for you to include additional benefits in your employee compensation package.

* **Appreciation & Rewards:** 8 out of 10 employees feel enthusiastic to contribute at work 
    * If their smaller or bigger contributions are appreciated by their managers 
    * And if they are rewarded with exciting gifts instantly 

So, make sure that you focus on recogizing your employees’ contributions and rewarding them with some creative gifts instantly

\
\

### **Esteem Needs**

In this slab as well you need to implement a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors like:

* **Respect:** 72% of surveyed employees rate “showing respect to all employees” as very important. So, promote a work environment where everybody respects each other irrespective of their work, role, and position

* **Financial Incentive:** A properly structured incentive program can increase employee performance by 44%. So, make sure that you provide good incentives to your employees along with the base pay.

* **Growth Opportunities:** 32% of people changing jobs cite boredom and the need for new challenges as their main reason for leaving a role. So, make sure that you provide good learning and career growth opportunities for your employees

\
\

### **Self Actualization**

Self-actualization is the final stage. This stage is the end goal for all the sales and revenue leaders. They can reach this stage by ensuring that all the needs of their employees are met. 

At this stage, a sales rep is fully satisfied with her job and feels connected to her organization. She is now contributing directly toward the success of your organization and is revered as a vital part of your company.

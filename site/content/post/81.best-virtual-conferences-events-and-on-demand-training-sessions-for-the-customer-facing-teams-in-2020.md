Professional conferences are that part of our work for which we all look forward to. We plan and schedule our work around these events. And, why not? After all, these conferences provide an opportunity to hear directly from industry leaders, break ourselves out of the usual work routine, and pick up new skills. If you are anything like us at SmatWinnr, you must be really excited about attending some of the famous professional conferences and events that are scheduled to happen in 2020. 

But this plan is now jeopardized by the ongoing pandemic. And, right now events and conferences around the world have either been postponed or canceled. A lot of these events have been converted to virtual events. This means that you can attend these events online from the comfort of your home. The best part is that much of the content is available for free.

We have compiled a list of such virtual events, conferences, and on-demand training sessions for the customer-facing teams. We find these extremely helpful and we believe that they will be helpful to you too. So, check them out below and choose the ones that fit your schedule.

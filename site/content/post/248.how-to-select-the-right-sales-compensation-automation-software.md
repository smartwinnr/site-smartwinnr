Organizations spend 10-15% of their revenue on commissions. So, surely [sales commissions](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/the-psychology-behind-an-effective-sales-compensation-strategy/) are one of the most important investments that companies make. But lets us be honest, using spreadsheets for calculating and maintaining the [compensation](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/statistics-about-the-state-of-sales-compensation-in-2022/) data is a huge pain. Because of obvious reasons like,

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <ul>
      <li>Spreadsheets don’t integrate with your internal data sources</li>
      <li>They are incapable of pulling in data automatically from the data sources</li>
      <li>Calculations have to be done manually (using formulas) in the spreadsheets</li>
      <li>Reps and managers don't get real-time visibility into the performance and commission data</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

So, right now, many organizations are leaving those outdated spreadsheets behind and adopting [sales compensation automation](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/why-is-it-necessary-to-automate-your-sales-incentive-compensation/) softwares for their sales compensation distribution needs. 

However, switching to compensation automation software is easier said than done. Because sales leaders now have a gamut of options available in the market to choose from. So, it’s easy for them to get swept up in the sea of sales incentive compensation solutions. 

And obviously, every sales leader wants to get a tool that works best for their business and team’s needs. To help you navigate this maze, we have discussed some of the key things/points that you need to look for as a recipient of a sales compensation automation system.

\
\

### **1. Seamlessly integrate with all your internal data sources in real-time**

One of the primary reasons why spreadsheets aren’t a great option for maintaining the incentive compensation data is because their inability to, 

* Integrate with your CRM and other data sources 
* And pull in the required from them automatically in real-time

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>So, when you are planning to invest in a compensation automation system, the first thing that you need to check is if it can,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automatically integrate with all of your internal data sources (multiple data sources) like,
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/gamifying-salesforce/">The CRM</a></li>
          <li>The HRMS</li>
          <li>And the other sales tools</li>
        </ul>
      </li>   
      <li>Pull-in the required data from these data sources in real-time</li>
      <li>And lets you build commission plans using that data</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **2. Provides the ability to set up complicated Quotas and Compensation Plans**

In today’s fast-paced world, quotas and [sales compensation plans](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/best-practices-to-design-your-sales-incentive-plan/) are not so straightforward. You need to set different quotas and [compensation plans](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/best-practices-to-implement-a-sales-incentive-plan/) for,

* For different sales reps
* For different sales roles
* Based on the territory that the sales rep is working in
* Based on the rep’s seniority and experience etc

You need to set multiple criteria based on various factors. So, your tool must be flexible enough to accommodate the most complex of compensation plans.  It must have the ability to support both simple and complex [compensation plans](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-gamification-can-help-to-take-your-incentive-plan-to-a-whole-new-level/).

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>The system needs to have a powerful Formula Builder to create complex formulas based on your incentive plans. Build flexible <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/create-the-most-effective-sales-commissions-structure/">payout structures</a> and different incentive components to cater to all sales roles and designations in your organization. You must be able to make adjustments to input data (eg. split deals, clawbacks, double comp, etc.) overriding automated commission calculations.</p>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **3. Reporting and Analytics should be easy for your sales reps and managers**

Real-time reporting and analytics are a key part of any sales compensation software. If they aren’t provided, then you’re missing out on the opportunity of,

* Motivating your salespeople
* And empowering your front-line managers to make better and data-driven decisions.

The devil is in the details, as they say, and when it comes to using sales incentive software, the devil really is in the details. A lot of the sales incentive software solutions only provide basic reporting capabilities. While they may be fine for keeping track of sales performance, but they lack critical features for analyzing and segmenting data and making other critical decisions.

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>Here are some things that you need to look out for in a sales compensation automation software pertaining to the reporting and analytics feature:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Payee Dashboards:</b> Your payees should have access to their commission data, status, quota assigned, and quota attainment information in real-time.</li>
      <li><b>Commissions Statement:</b> Payees should be able to look at their detailed commission report with payouts at the deal level and also plan level (base or spiff). They should also be able to export the data.</li>
      <li><b>Manager Level Views:</b> <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-make-your-sales-compensation-motivating-for-the-managers/">Managers</a> should have the flexibility to look at their reportees’ performance by team, plan, quota, to name a few.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

Other critical details include the ability to track sales performance across multiple locations, or multiple currencies, or multiple compensation plans. And have an aggregated view of analytics across geographies.

\
\

### **4. Encourages action from reps through Motivational Nudges**

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>In order to take your employee motivation to the next level, you need to keep your reps informed about,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What they have earned so far?</li>
      <li>Which activities bring them what incentives?</li>
      <li>What will they earn if they complete a certain task or reach a certain goal?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

These things can be communicated to them through what is known as [motivational nudges](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-use-ai-driven-nudges-to-improve-the-sales-performance-of-the-pharma-sales-reps/). Motivational nudges are the notifications that sales reps receive on their mobile devices which guide them to perform certain activities that are important and that which would bring them good incentives. So, we would advise that you pick the software which has the capability of automatically delivers AI-driven nudges.

\
\

### **5. Scalability**
Now let’s say you have created various commission plans for all your employees and then recruit 50 new reps in your sales team. You need to include these new reps in one of your compensation plans. If your system doesn’t allow you to add these new people to your existing compensation plans, then it will become a huge pain for you. Because you will have to create a new plan from scratch just to accommodate these new members. 

Even if you take that pain and do create a plan from scratch for the new people, what if you have more batches of new reps coming in? Are you going to create new plans, again and again, every time there is a new batch of new hires? 

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>In order to save yourselves from this repetitive work, you need to ensure that your sales compensation automation system is scalable. Meaning, it should allow you to create a compensation plan and then let you add as many people as you like to that plan at any given time.</p>

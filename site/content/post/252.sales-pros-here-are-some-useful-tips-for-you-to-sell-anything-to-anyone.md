One of the most valuable skills that a salesperson can have is the knowledge of **how to sell anything to anyone.** Salespeople today are the primary differentiators in all purchases. As products and services become increasingly commoditized, buyers are aware that they can get a similar offering from any other company.

But what they can't get from just any vendor is the same pleasant buying experience that is created by your company’s sales rep.

This means salespeople have almost complete control of their own destinies. So, despite of having, 

* A crummy product line
* A bad month 
* Being forced to work completely remotely 
* Or [having less-than-stellar leads](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/mql-vs-sql-what-are-they-and-how-do-they-differ/) 

You can succeed in your sales game by making yourself more buyer-centric and buyer-friendly.
 
Regardless of what industry you're in, what type of product you sell and what kind of customer base you sell into, there are a few simple techniques that can be applied to any sales situation. These techniques can help you sell more to just about anybody. 
 
In this post, I’ll provide you with these great sales [techniques for selling ](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/7-selling-skills-that-are-essential-to-ace-remote-sales/) anything to anyone

\
\

### **1. Do your Research**

Research is the key to successful sales today. If you want your prospects to give you their time to learn about your product, you will need to invest your time learning about them first. In the age of social media, there's no excuse to call or email a buyer with no knowledge of what they do and what they care about.

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>It’s not a huge and time-taking task to research your prospect before contacting them. Depending on your particular sales cycle, as little as five or 10 minutes per prospect might be enough.</p>
    <p>Below are some places to conduct research on your prospects before you attempt to engage them in conversation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> LinkedIn</li>
      <li> Twitter (prospect's individual account and company's account)</li>
      <li> Company's press releases page</li>
      <li> Competitors' press releases pages</li>
      <li> Blogs</li>
      <li> Company financial statements</li>
      <li> Facebook</li>
      <li> Google (prospect and company)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **2. Understand your customers’ needs and motivations**

Whatever it is that you are selling, the most important part of salesmanship is understanding the needs of your customer and figuring out how to meet them.

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>Try finding answers to these questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Why should people care about what you’re selling? </li>
      <li> How is your product or service providing value to them? </li>
      <li> Pay attention to what’s driving your potential client to take your meeting in the first place and address that in your pitch.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In almost every sales scenario, a salesperson who focuses on customer service and how a product is able to meet its customer’s needs will be much more successful than a salesperson who focuses on the features and specifications of the product itself.</p>
    <p>Perhaps your customer has pain points that your product is able to alleviate, or perhaps they have desires that it is able to fulfill.</p>
    <p>Once you determine the needs of your target customer and how your product is able to meet them, centering your sales pitch around meeting those needs is the best way by far to close a sale.</p>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **3. Know who to sell to**

You need to carefully analyze every prospect and target the right people while [selling your products or services.](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-effectively-drive-up-selling-and-cross-selling/) Otherwise, you are merely wasting your time on the wrong people and this not going to help you in any way.

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>For example: If you’re selling a widget that costs $50K, don’t try to sell it to the guy whose widget budget is $2k. A common mistake salespeople make is trying to sell to anyone and everyone. Make sure whatever you’re selling fulfills your potential client’s needs and is realistic for them. This way, you’re much more likely to get that sale! </p>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **4. Keep your sales pitch simple**

In an attempt to sound more knowledgeable don’t overcomplicate your sales pitch. The mark of true knowledge is to simplify everything that you know and present it in a way that even an average person would understand. 

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>Keep your pitch simple. If it’s an elevator pitch, then it has to be under 30 seconds. Practice your elevator pitch and aim for perfection. </p>
    <p>The key to crafting a captivating sales pitch is to think about the person you’re pitching to. Make your approach about their needs. Put yourself in their shoes and think about how they’ll feel after the pitch/meeting. Craft your pitch accordingly.</p>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **5. Learn to sell yourself**

Apart from your product and service, remember that you are also selling yourself as a trusted representative of your company. Whether you’re [cold calling a prospect](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/sales-cold-call-script-for-sdrs/) or have spoken with them before, it’s important to keep in mind that before a person is going to be willing to hand over their hard-earned money to you, they’ve got to like you, the salesperson, just as much as they like the product or service that you are selling.

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>When you get in contact with a prospective customer, make sure to strike up a casual conversation. Take a little time to know your customer and let them get to know you. </p>
    <p>Tell them a quick story, make them laugh, and overall simply let your personality shine.</p>
    <p>If you can make your customer see you as a person and perhaps even as a friend rather than just someone who is trying to sell something to them, they’ll be far more inclined to buy something from you.</p>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **6. Make it about them**

Do you have a friend or family member who monopolizes every conversation? They probably aren't your favorite person to talk to. Add a bragging tone to that and they become especially intolerable.

Just like you don't like listening to a self-absorbed acquaintance blabber, buyers don't like listening to salespeople who talk at length about their company or offerings. What you perceive as informative and interesting, [prospects perceive as obnoxious and irrelevant.](https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-overcome-prospects-resistance/)

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>So an important principle that you need to incorporate into your sales practice is to always make everything that you do about your buyer. Every email you write, voicemail you leave, demo you give, and meeting you attend should place the focus squarely on the buyer. Ask yourself constantly: <i>"What's the relevance to this particular prospect?"</i> and customize each interaction accordingly. </p>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **7. Ask, Listen and Repeat**

I understand that you’ve done your research and learned most things about your prospect. Like,

* The history of the prospect
* Their purchasing capabilities
* Their pain points etc
 
With all this information at hand, it is easy to be overcome by passion and pitch what you think is best for the prospect. But don't that. Here's why. If you do that, you risk coming across as pushy. You make them feel like the meeting is all about you and not about them. You need to make sure that you give the utmost importance to the people across the table. It's about their needs and goals.

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>So ask. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Ask how you can help them</li>
      <li> Ask what their <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/how-to-set-smart-goles-for-your-sales-team/">goals</a> are</li>
      <li> Ask what their concerns are</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then listen. <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/open-ended-sales-questions-that-your-reps-can-use-to-get-prospects-talking/">Ask leading questions</a> and <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-active-listening-in-sales/">listen some more.</a> Keep listening until you have a pretty clear understanding of the whole picture.</p>
    <p>This doesn’t mean that you hound them with questions. Sometimes you listen a little, give a little, and go back and forth for a few meetings. That's fine. You do want to be flexible and you don't want to be pushy. Just see if you can find a way to get them to speak first. Information is power.</p>
    <p>Also, listen for what really and truly matters to them. They might say a lot, but if you really listen, you'll discern </p>
    <ul>
      <li> What's really in it for them, </li>
      <li> What motivates them, </li>
      <li> And what obstacles you have to overcome. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **8. Contribute first and then try selling**

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>Don't rush to close the sale. If you push the sale too aggressively, you run the risk of angering the prospect or scaring them away. Instead, offer your help in the way you think would be most valuable. Make sure that you give enough reasons for the client to reach the purchase decision by themselves. Not sure where you can be of service? Ask. </p>
    <p>Maybe you can send them a breakdown of the latest features of your product or send them a piece of content that speaks to their needs. Perhaps you can draw on your expertise to speak about industry-wide trends the buyer might not be aware of. </p>
  </div>
</div>

\

<div class="ml_pro_tip ml-margin-bottom20 ml-margin-bottom20"> <b>Pro tip: </b>Save templates of common questions you receive from buyers, so you can quickly follow up with a relevant message. 
</div>

Position yourself as an advisor who wants to help, rather than a salesperson thirsty to sell. With this approach, you'll find a more receptive audience when you finally get around to connecting their problem with your offering. In short: Always Be Helping.

\
\

### **9. Be aware of the psychological quirks that can drive sales**

Our brains are wired to respond to certain situations in specific ways. Being aware of these psychological tricks can help you harness them to your benefit while selling.

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>Here are just a few of the quirks relevant to salespeople: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Anchoring effect: </b>The information we receive first acts as an anchor against which we evaluate all further data. </li>
      <li> <b>Decoy effect: </b><a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/what-is-the-goldilocks-effect-and-how-to-apply-it-in-your-business/">A third option can sometimes help people choose between two possibilities. </a></li>
      <li> <b>Rhyme-as-reason effect: </b>Rhyming statements seem truer than non-rhyming ones. </li>
      <li> <b>Loss aversion: </b>We react more strongly to the possibility of losing something we currently have than the possibility of gaining something we don't. </li>
      <li> <b>Peak-end rule: </b>People remember the end and a high point within a presentation more vividly than any other section. </li>
      <li> <b>Curse of knowledge: </b>When someone who knows a lot about a given subject is unable to relate to someone who is not as familiar. </li>
      <li> <b>Confirmation bias: </b>We are more likely to accept information that aligns with our beliefs than contradictory evidence — no matter how compelling. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **10. Meet them at their level**

As a salesperson, you might believe in bringing your own unique personality to the selling process and that is great. But you must also bear in mind that you should pay attention to your prospect's personality traits as well and tailor your approach accordingly. Because each individual’s personal attributes will have a huge impact on 

* The way they like to be sold 
* And the information that they would prioritize


<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>Here's a brief <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/6-buyer-personas-and-how-to-train-your-team-to-sell/">breakdown of the four main personality types,</a> and their preferences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Assertive: </b>Interested in results and the bottom line </li>
      <li> <b>Amiable: </b>Interested in creative ideas and big-picture visions</li>
      <li> <b>Expressive: </b>Interested in people and how ideas affect others </li>
      <li> <b>Analytics: </b>Interested in facts, figures, and data </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you know which category your prospect fits into, play to their preferences and customize your messaging and presentation to nail what's most important to them.</p>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **11. Hit an emotional high point**

In reality, there's no such thing as a purely rational decision. We may like it or not, our emotions color how we process information and make decisions. With this in mind, salespeople who appeal solely to their buyers' logic are doing themselves a disservice.

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>Every sales message, presentation, and meeting should speak to the prospect's emotions as well as their rational mind. According to sales experts, the following emotions impact decision making:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Greed</li>
      <li> Fear</li>
      <li> Altruism </li>
      <li> Envy </li>
      <li> Pride </li>
      <li> Shame </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of these are unpleasant feelings you don't want buyers associating with you or your company. So, make sure to be subtle while making emotional appeals. In addition, don't try to bring forth all of these feelings. Choose one or two that will resonate and subtly mix them in. </p>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **12. Keep in mind that you’re selling to a person**

While sending countless outreaches to your prospects, day in and day out, you need to also remember that they are people. And trust me, they would like to be treated as people.

So, use yourself as a litmus test before you send out anything to a customer. Ask yourself, 

* Would you like getting this email? 
* Would you appreciate this voicemail?


<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>If your answer is no, then there's a good chance your buyer won't either </p>
    <p>It's important to be professional in sales, but it's also important to be personable. Buyers have lives outside of work, and things they're passionate about that have nothing to do with their jobs. <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/4-techniques-to-build-rapport-virtually/">Build real rapport with your prospects</a> by letting the conversation drift to personal every once in a while. It doesn't have to be, and shouldn't be, all business all the time.</p>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **Selling Products**

Products are concrete solutions to your customer’s problems. With products, sales reps have the advantage of showcasing a tangible item to the customers. But selling products shouldn’t be mistaken as easy. Customers still need to be convinced as to why they should purchase your product over someone else's.

\
\

### **1. Focus on your customer’s needs**

As stated previously, you’ll want to focus on your customer’s pain points. When you have a clear understanding of their issues, you can then address how your product can solve them. Your customer’s needs should always be your North star.

\
\

### **2. Use demonstrations to your advantage**

One of the perks of selling a product is that it’s easier for you to demonstrate its value to your customers. You can showcase 

* The product 
* Its features 
* And how it works 
to the prospective customers

Doing a demonstration or having the customer try it out themselves is a great way to illustrate the product's value. Customers won’t have to guess how they would use the product or what it actually does. They can see it in action.

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>So, use your demonstration to point out the product’s value in real-time, and explain the benefits to your prospective customers. <a href="https://www.smartwinnr.com/post/puppy-dog-close-technique-let-your-customers-experience-your-brand-personally/"> Most people buying a new car want to test drive it first before making a decision. People buying software want to view the interface and interact with it prior to committing to buy.</a> Demonstrations are where you can really let the product shine.</p>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **3. Highlight appealing or exclusive product features**

Products typically give customers something tangible (unless it's software) that they can see and touch. They also provide them the opportunity to compare your product with other similar products. So, hone in on what features differentiate your product from the pack. 

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p><i>Do you have features in your products that are really unique and improvise your product’s performance?</i> If so, then highlight those features and drive the point home for your prospects. Make the case for why your product’s features are an improvement over the competition and can provide better results for your customers.</p>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **Selling Services**

Selling a product is more transactional, often with a one-time purchase. But selling a service requires more nuance. Since there is no tangible product here, you’ll need to sell prospective customers on the vision that your service will improve their life or business.

\
\

### **1. Focus more on building relationships (rather than selling)**

This may sound counterintuitive, but it’s important to develop a rapport with your potential customers. Chances are, people aren’t going to buy as soon as you first meet them, or when they first visit your website. So, you shouldn’t go with the mindset of giving just one pitch, and then you’re done. Instead, think long-term. 

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>Think about how you can build a long-term connection with the customer that results in them not just purchasing your service but becoming loyal customers of your company.</p>
    <p>You’ll need to ask questions to find more information about their needs and wants. From there you can start to connect the dots about which attributes of your service might be the most beneficial for their specific problems. Customers should think you have their best interests in mind before buying.</p>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **2. Leverage customer testimonials to build trust**

Services are bought by the customers based on the long-term benefit or the potential success that they may have using it. In this case, there isn’t a tangible product for them to look to for reference. So, if you have existing customers that are happy with your service, have them offer a testimonial. Testimonials can help you gain the trust of your potential customers, especially if it's a well-known brand speaking about the benefits of using your service.

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>With these testimonials, your potential buyers will be able to see themselves in your existing happy customers. They can look to see if their organization has a similar business model and better understand how your service could work for them. Testimonials help build trust with customers by establishing your business as an authority or expert in the field. And will help persuade them to choose you over other service providers.</p>
  </div>
</div>

\
\

### **3. Emphasize your service’s benefits**

<div class="ml_special_div_blog ml-margin-bottom10">
  <div class="ml_special_div_blog_content ml-margin-top10 ml-margin-bottom10">
    <p>You can talk about how great your service is, but if you don’t drive home why customers should buy it, you’re wasting your time. Once you’ve built a relationship with potential customers and figured out their pain points, communicate how using your service will resolve their issues and remove obstacles.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Are there processes your service can simplify? </i></li>
      <li><i>Will using your service save them money or time? </i></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If so, be vocal about it, and give a detailed explanation of how that will happen</p>
  </div>
</div>

Selling your service successfully will largely depend on how well you can communicate its value to your potential customers. You’ll need to help them visualize how your service will improve their lives or business.

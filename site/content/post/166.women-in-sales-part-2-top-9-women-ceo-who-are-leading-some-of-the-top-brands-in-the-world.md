I hear a lot of people say that the glass ceiling in corporate boardrooms is still intact. But I do see a few cracks appearing, here and there.

Today, women are running some of the world’s most recognized brands. Although their number is significantly lower than that of the number of men in the executive roles, the women’s ranks are continuously growing.

In this blog, we are going to talk about 10 amazing women CEOs who are leading the Fortune 500 companies. From Youtube to Gap and from Oracle to Bumble, these inspiring women are changing the corporate game.

<br>

### **1. Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors**

Mary Barra, not only is the first female CEO of General Motors but she is pretty much the first for a major automobile company in the U.S. She  took over as the CEO in January 2014 from Daniel Akerson (the man credited for turning the company profitable after it filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2011)

Barra is leading the charge at GM to transition their vehicles into electric vehicles by 2035. Most recently, 

* She was ranked second on Fortune's 2020 Most Powerful Women in Business list 
* And she was ranked sixth on Forbes' 100 Most Powerful Women in the World 2020

### **2. Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube**

In 2014, Susan Wojcicki became the CEO of YouTube. But even before this raise as a CEO, she was already an entrepreneur paving her way as one of the highest-performing female CEOs.

Wojcicki was 11 years old when she started her first business. She used to go from door-to-door selling spice ropes (plaited yarn threaded with spices) in her hometown of Palo Alto, California.

She used to write for her school newspaper before she took up studying humanities in college. She then graduated in history and literature with honors, from Harvard University. She also had plans to do a Ph.D. in economics before moving into a career in academia. Those plans later shifted when she discovered her interest in technology.

She eventually found herself in a marketing role at Intel and it was here that a mutual friend introduced her to Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google. The duo then rented Wojcicki’s garage to build the search engine. They soon rented out her bedrooms on the entire ground floor as well. Wojcicki welcomed the financial assistance since she and her husband were cash-strapped with a mortgage, student loan debts, and a baby on the way.

Wojcicki became the 16th employee and marketing manager of Google by 1999. She was then got promoted to the position of the Senior Vice President of Advertising and Commerce. At this point, she oversaw Google’s Google Video Service (which was YouTube’s competitor at that time). Seeing YouTube’s potential, Wojcicki proposed Google’s purchase of YouTube. Eventually, in 2006, she handled YouTube’s acquisition for US$1.65.

### **3. Sonia Syngal, CEO of Gap**

Syngal was made the CEO of Gap in March 2020. This was the time when retailers around the world were impacted by lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic. Before becoming Gap’s CEO, she served as CEO of Old Navy (one of Gap's brands). She held this post since 2016.

In the spring and summer of 2020, she led the charge of repurposing fabric to make face masks. And this initiative resulted in bringing in $130 million in sales. She was also featured on Fortune's 2020 Most Powerful Women in Business list.

### **5. Whitney Wolf Herd, CEO of Bumble**

Long before she started Bumble, Whitney Wolfe Herd began her entrepreneurial journey. At age of 22, she joined Hatch Labs. At this New York City incubator, she met Sean Rad and became involved with the startup Cardify. Although eventually, this project was abandoned, her connection with Rad soon saw her joining his other venture in 2012– a dating app called Tinder.
 
Whitney became the marketing manager for Tinder and she is also credited for creating the app’s name and logo. She says that the signature flame logo is a reference to her having to use small sticks (tinder) to start the fireplace at her father’s cabin in Montana. 

In 2014, however, Whitney left tender because of some tensions with company’s executives. She then created her own dating app which was designed to give women more control. And thus, Bumble was born. By 2017, Bumble had over 22 million registered users.

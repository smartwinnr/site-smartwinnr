I hear a lot of people say that the glass ceiling in corporate boardrooms is still intact. But I do see a few cracks appearing, here and there.

Today, women are running some of the world’s most recognized brands. Although their number is significantly lower than that of the number of men in the executive roles, the women’s ranks are continuously growing.

In this blog, we are going to talk about 10 amazing women CEOs who are leading the Fortune 500 companies. From Youtube to Gap and from Oracle to Bumble, these inspiring women are changing the corporate game.

<br>

## **1. Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors**

Mary Barra is the first female CEO of General Motors. And she is pretty much the first for a major automobile company in the U.S. She slid into the driver’s seat at GM in January 2014, taking over from Daniel Akerson, the man credited for turning the company profitable after it filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2011.


Barra is leading the charge for GM to transition to electric vehicles by 2035. She ranked second on Fortune's 2020 Most Powerful Women in Business list and sixth on Forbes' 100 Most Powerful Women in the World 2020.

## **2. Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube**

<img src="/images/blog-166/susan.jpeg">

Susan Wojcicki took the helm of YouTube in 2014. But long before her rise as the video-sharing platform’s CEO, she was already an entrepreneur paving her way as one of today’s highest-performing female CEOs. Wojcicki started her first business at the age of 11, going door-to-door selling spice ropes (plaited yarn threaded with spices) in her hometown of Palo Alto, California.

She wrote for the school newspaper before studying humanities in college and taking on her first computer science class. At Harvard University she graduated from history and literature with honors alongside plans for a Ph.D. in economics before moving into a career in academia. Those plans shifted when she discovered her interest in technology.

She’d eventually find herself in a marketing role for Intel and it was here that a mutual friend introduced her to Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google. The duo rented Wojcicki’s garage to build the search engine. They soon rented out her bedrooms on the entire ground floor as well. Wojcicki welcomed the financial assistance since she and her husband were cash-strapped with a mortgage, student loan debts, and a baby on the way.

By 1999, she would become Google’s 16th employee and marketing manager. She then progressed to Senior Vice President of Advertising and Commerce, where she also oversaw Google’s Google Video Service – YouTube’s competitor at the time. Seeing YouTube’s potential, Wojcicki proposed Google’s purchase of YouTube and eventually handled its acquisition for US$1.65 billion in 2006.

## **3. Sonia Syngal, CEO of Gap**

Syngal was tapped as the CEO of Gap in March 2020, just as retailers were impacted by lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic. Previously, she served as CEO of Old Navy, one of Gap's brands, a post she had held since 2016.

In the spring and summer of 2020, she led the charge to repurpose fabric to make face masks, which resulted in $130 million in sales. She is also included on Fortune's 2020 Most Powerful Women in Business list.

Whitney Wolfe Herd began her entrepreneurial journey long before she started Bumble. At age of 22, she joined Hatch Labs. It was at this New York City incubator that she met Sean Rad and became involved with the startup Cardify. The project was eventually abandoned but her connection with Rad soon saw her joining his other venture in 2012 – a dating app called Tinder.
 
Wolfe Herd became the marketing manager for Tinder and is also credited for creating the app’s name and logo. The signature flame logo is a reference to her having to use small sticks (tinder) to start the fireplace at her father’s cabin in Montana. 


After tensions with company executives, Wolfe Herd left Tinder in 2014 and created her own dating app designed to give women more control. Thus, Bumble was born. By 2017, Bumble had amassed over 22 million registered users.


As one of the most important women in tech today, Wolfe Herd is also the CEO of the newly acquired MagicLab, the parent company of multiple popular dating apps (Bumble, Latch, Badoo), valued at US$3 billion with an estimated 75 million users across its entire portfolio.

## **8. Marilyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin**

<img src="/images/blog-166/marillyn-hewson.jpeg">

Some of the world’s most advanced fighter weapons have the “Lockheed Martin” name on them. Lockheed Martin is an American global aerospace, defense, security, and advanced technologies company. The CEO of this company is arguably one of the world’s most powerful women: Marillyn Hewson.

The company itself contracts to America’s most high-profile organizations including surveillance and information processing for the CIA, FBI, IRS, NSA, and The Pentagon. In 2008 alone it received US$36 billion in government contracts, the most for any company in history.

Hewson was raised by her mother who was a former member of the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) – the women’s branch of the United States Army. Her father passed away when she was only nine and she credits her leadership skills to her mother’s ability to raise five children on her own. 

Before her Lockheed Martin days, she completed a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration as well as a Master of Arts degree in economics from the University of Alabama. She also eventually attend the Columbia Business School and Harvard Business School executive development programs.

She first joined the Lockheed Corporation as a senior industrial engineer in 1983. This was followed by her holding numerous executive positions within the company including President and Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President of Lockheed Martin's Electronic Systems business area, President of Lockheed Martin Systems Integration, Executive Vice President of Global Sustainment for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, President and General Manager of Kelly Aviation Center, L.P., and President of Lockheed Martin Logistics Services.

She was elected to join Lockheed Martin’s board of directors in 2012. And then she took the role of CEO in the year 2013.

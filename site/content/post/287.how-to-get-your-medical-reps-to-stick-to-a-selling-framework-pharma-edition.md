Okay, so you've got this new sales framework. It's like a 360-degree roadmap to successfully interacting with HCPs, right? But getting your medical reps to follow it? That’s the real challenge.

It's not enough to just give them the framework. They must live by it. You know, make it part of their daily grind. 

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">What is a Selling Framework?</h3>

A selling framework is a roadmap that guides medical reps through the entire sales cycle. From initial contact with healthcare professionals to closing deals.

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">Why does it even matter in the Pharma Industry?</h3>

Simple.  It helps MRs:

* <p>Stay compliant with industry rules </p>
* <p>Present products effectively </p>
* <p>Ensure a consistent approach across the team </p>

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">Types of Selling Frameworks</h3>

**Quick Reminder**:For a deep dive into the top 6 selling methodologies, check out our  blog.

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">Key Elements of an Effective Selling Framework </h3>

![Key Elements of an Effective Selling Framework](/images/blog-287/key_elements_of_an_effective_selling_framework.png)

**Clear Objectives**: Set SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound). 

**Structured Process**: Define each step 

* <p><b>Prospecting</b>: Identify potential prospects.</p>
* <p><b>Engagement</b>: Maintain contact.</p>
* <p><b>Needs Assessment</b>: Understand their needs.</p>
* <p><b>Handling Objections</b>: Show product value.</p>
* <p><b>Closing</b>: Finalize deals.</p>

**Training**: Use AI role-plays for initial and ongoing training. 

**Resources**: Provide microlearning modules (audio, video, quizzes, PDFs). 

Using Selling Methodologies to Enhance Framework Adherence 

SPIN Selling: Enhancing Needs Assessment 

**SPIN Selling** is highly effective for improving the needs assessment phase. Asking smart questions to find out what HCPs really want. It helps MRs understand the underlying gap before making a pitch. 

**Below is an example, medical sales reps can practice.** 

*Situation: How many patients with Type 2 Diabetes do you typically see in a week?*

*Problem: Are you satisfied with the current treatment outcomes for patients with uncontrolled blood sugar?*

*Implication: How does inconsistent blood sugar control impact patient quality of life?*

*Need-Payoff: How would a treatment option that significantly reduces HbA1c levels benefit your patients?*

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">Consultative Selling: Building Strong Relationships</h3>

Imagine you have a friend who needs help. You listen to their problems and find a way to help, right? That's what consultative selling is like. 

When you talk to HCPs, listen to what they need. Don't just tell them about your medicine. Show them how your medicine can help them treat their patients.

*MR: "Dr. Lee, I know managing diabetes can be tough. What are some of the biggest challenges you face with your patients?"* 

*Dr. Lee: "Well, getting patients to control their blood sugar is a big one."* 

*MR: "I understand. Many doctors said this. Have you considered using a medication that has fewer side effects and helps improve blood sugar control?"* 

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">Solution Selling: Effective Presentation and Closing</h3>

**Solution Selling** focuses on presenting solutions to specific problems rather than just selling a product. It focuses on the presentation and closing stages of your framework.  

**Suggestion**: Instead of just telling doctors about the drug's features (like how it works or its ingredients), you focus on the problem the drug solves: high blood sugar. 

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">Challenger Sale: Identifying Pain Points</h3>

As the name suggests, focus on challenging the status quo and offering a new perspective. 

Instead of just agreeing with the HCP, challenge their current approach. Show them a better way to treat patients.

***MR***: *"Dr. Nick, I know you've been prescribing medicine X for years. While it's effective, have you considered the potential side effects and long-term implications for your patients?"*

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">Value Selling: Demonstrating ROI</h3>

Show HCPs how your product can be effective and improve patient outcomes. Focus on quantifying the value. 

***MR***: *"Dr. Lee, our new asthma inhaler has been proven to reduce the frequency of severe asthma attacks by 30%. This means fewer ER visits, shorter hospital stays, and improved patient quality of life.”*

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">Sandler Selling System: Effective Questioning </h3>

**What it is**: Sandler Selling uses a questioning technique to uncover the HCP’s pain points and budget(sometimes). 

**Example Questions**: 

* <p><b>Pain Questions</b>: "What challenges are you facing with patient compliance?" </p>
* <p><b>Budget Questions</b>: "What’s the financial impact of these compliance issues?"</p>
* <p><b>Decision Questions</b>: "How do you decide on new treatment protocols?"</p>

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">MEDDIC: Qualifying Leads/Deals</h3>

MEDDIC is a qualification framework that ensures you're targeting the right leads (HCP). 

As the name is here’s some example questions: 

* <p><b>Metrics</b>: "What metrics are you using to measure treatment success?"</p>
* <p><b>Economic Buyer</b>: "Who makes the final decision on new medication?"</p>
* <p><b>Decision Criteria</b>: "What criteria are essential for your decision?"</p>
* <p><b>Decision Process</b>: "What steps are involved in your decision-making process?"</p>
* <p><b>Identify Pain</b>: "What are the biggest challenges you face in patient care?"</p>
* <p><b>Champion</b>: "Who in your team will advocate for our solution?"</p>

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">SNAP Selling: Simplifying the Process</h3>

In short, it means quick and effective pitches. SNAP Selling aims to simplify the sales process and make it easy for buyers to make decisions. 

***MR***: *"Dr. Lee, I know you're incredibly busy, so I'll be direct. Our new rapid-onset migraine medicine delivers relief in under 15 minutes. It's a game-changer for your patients experiencing severe migraines, right?"* 

***Dr. Lee***: *"That's impressive. How does it compare to current treatments?"*

***MR***: *"It's significantly faster acting, Dr. Lee. Patients experience relief much quicker, leading to reduced emergency room visits."*

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">NEAT Selling: Identifying Needs and Solutions</h3>

Focuses on core needs, economic impact, and timeline of the HCP. 

***MR***: *"Dr. Lee, I understand you're seeing an increase in diabetic patients. How is that impacting your practice? What are your specific challenges in managing their care?"*
 
<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">Target Account Selling: Prioritizing High-Value Accounts</h3>

**What it is**: This methodology focuses on prioritizing and selling to high-value accounts that align well with your product.

**Suggestion**: Focus on key accounts that have a high potential for sales.

<h3 class="ml-bold-text ml-margin-top-bottom20">Final Thoughts</h3>

Finding the right sales approach is tough. Different MRs need different methods. SmartWinnr AI can help your MRs figure out what works best. Independently practice with AI HCP, find their best fit and master the product pitch.

The Leaderboard shows the `name`, `score`, `region` and highlights your `ranking` in orange. You can choose to see the leaderboard for last quarter by tapping on the `<Q3, 2017` button on the left towards the top of the screen. You can also choose to see the `All Time` Leaderboard covering all quarters in a year by clicking on the `All Time` button

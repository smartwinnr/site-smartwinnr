## What is a Home Screen?
The Home screen is the 1st screen of the `SmartWinnr app`. It shows a summary of the quizzes that have been assigned to you, the different notifications and an overview of the number of quizzes that you have already completed, a number of quizzes that are pending and your percentage score till now.

You can directly tap on an `Assigned Quiz` to start answering the questions.

        <h2><b>SmartWinnr's GDPR Commitment</b></h2><br>
        <div>
          <h4><b>Dedication to your data privacy </b></h4>
          <p>
          We are wholly invested in our customers' success and the protection of data. One way that we deliver on this promise is by helping SmartWinnr customers and users understand, and where applicable, comply with the General Data Protection Regulation <a href="" target="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules_en" class="ml_custom_link">(GDPR)</a>. The GDPR is designed to give EU citizens more control over their data and seeks to unify a number of existing privacy and security laws under one comprehensive law. The GDPR not only applies to organizations located within the EU, but it also applies to all companies processing and holding the personal data of data subjects residing in the European Union, regardless of the company’s location.
          The following sections outline our approach and investment in GDPR compliance in service of our customers and individual data subjects.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4><b>Security and certifications</b></h4>
          <p>
            Protecting our customers' information and their user's privacy is extremely important to us. We are entrusted with some of our customer's most valuable data, which is why we have built security into every layer of the SmartWinnr Cloud architecture. We provide replication, backup, and disaster recovery planning, encryption in transit and at rest, advanced threat detection, common controls, and more. Visit the SmartWinnr Security Practices page to learn more about our approach to security.
            Additionally, we have devoted significant resources towards ensuring our cloud products are built and designed in accordance with widely accepted standards and certifications. These standards mirror many of the security and privacy requirements of the GDPR and give our customers a transparent framework by which to measure our software development and data management practices. Our data centers, co-location, and managed service providers undergo a thorough security assessment as a part of the evaluation process and then undergo regular SOC 1, SOC 2, and/or ISO/IEC 27001 audits thereafter.
          </p>

      <div>
          <h4><b>International data transfers</b></h4>
          <p>
             As a company with a global customer base and operations, SmartWinnr must be able to transfer and access data around the world. We understand and respect the rules for onward transfers of personal data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), and offer customers a robust international data transfer framework as a part our Data Processing Addendum. This addendum ensures that our customers can lawfully transfer personal data to SmartWinnr Cloud products outside of the EEA by relying on the Standard Contractual Clauses. This addendum also contains specific provisions to assist customers in their compliance with the GDPR.
            Whenever we share your data with SmartWinnr service providers, we remain accountable to you for how it is used by any of these organizations. We require all service providers to undergo a thorough diligence process and enter into contracts which ensure our customers' personal data receives adequate protection and safeguards. We are aware that the European Data Protection Board recently issued further guidance on supplementary measures to meet the adequacy requirement of GDPR. We will continue to analyze these requirements and any others issued by European data protection authorities as they arise.
            <br>
              For more information on how we transfer and process personal data, see our Privacy Policy.

          <p>
            Data for all our enterprise customers in the EU is hosted in AWS Ireland data centers.

            We’re also ready to facilitate your customers’ requests to export their data, should you host your customer data on SmartWinnr products. SmartWinnr provides robust data portability and data management tools for exporting product and user data.

      <h4><b>Choice and consent</b></h4>
          <p>
            We value choice and transparency around how we collect, use, and share information, and provide optionality within different product or account settings. Our Privacy Policy summarizes those choices, how to exercise them, and any relevant limitations.
            <br>
